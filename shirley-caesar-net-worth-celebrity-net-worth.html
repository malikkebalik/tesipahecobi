Shirley Caesar has released over 40 albums during her seven-decade career. Often dubbed "The First Lady of Gospel," she has won several Grammy, Dove, and Stellar Awards, and in 2017 was given a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Caesar has made a number of notable appearances over the years, including on televised programs and at White House events.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Shirley Caesar was born on October 13, 1938 in Durham, North Carolina as the tenth of 13 children of Hallie and Jim. Her father, a well-known local gospel singer, passed away when Caesar was seven. As a child, Caesar often sang for family and friends, and eventually was invited to sing all across the Carolinas at various events.</p><h2 id=caravans><strong>The Caravans</strong></h2><p>In 1958, Caesar approached gospel singer Albertina Walker about joining her popular gospel group the Caravans. Impressed by Caesar's singing, she welcomed her in. Caesar went on to have great success with the Caravans, particularly with the hit songs "Sweeping Through the City" and "No Coward Soldier." After eight years with the group, she left when she landed a solo recording contract with Hob Records.</p><h2 id=hob-records-roadshow-records><strong>Hob Records and Roadshow Records</strong></h2><p>Caesar's first LP for Hob Records was "I'll Go," which included the popular tracks "Oh Peter, Don't Be Afraid" and "Choose Ye This Day." She had further hits with such songs as "God's Not Dead, He's Yet Alive" and "Don't Drive Your Mama Away." In 1971, Caesar won her first Grammy Award for her recording of "Put Your Hand in the Hand of the Man." Four years later, she had her first Gold-certified record with the song "No Charge." Despite her success, Caesar eventually decided to leave Hob Records to reach a larger audience. She moved away from Christian record labels and signed with the secular Roadshow Records in 1977. The first woman ever to record on the label, she released her debut studio album, "First Lady," later in the year. Although the album sold poorly, its title became the inspiration for Caesar's nickname "The First Lady of Gospel." Caesar released her second and final album for Roadshow Records, "From the Heart," in 1978.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-227247 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Shirley-Caesar.jpg alt width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-227247 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=further-music-successes><strong>Further Music Successes</strong></h2><p>In 1980, Caesar signed with Word Records.
