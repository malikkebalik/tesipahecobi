I don't know about you, but growing up in the '90s, I've always wanted to sport a <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Saved By The Bell </i>Halloween costume</a>. I think this is my chance, and it could be yours, too. This Halloween might be the one where I can finally rock that signature Kelly hairstyle. I mean we're already wearing denim jackets, crop tops, and platforms on the daily — might as well go full on out for Halloween, amirite?</p><p>I think it's safe to say that <i>Saved By The Bell</i> could be considered one of the most memorable '90s shows of all time. From Lisa Turtle's kickass outfits to A.C. Slater's dimples, I think every '90s kid can admit that the iconic TV show had an impact on them. I mean, come on — there's no way you lived through the '90s without wanting a Zack and Kelly romance.</p><p>So, what better way to pay an ode to the original gang of the '90s and dress up like your favorite character? Who knows, maybe you can get your squad to do it altogether? I think, yes.</p><p>Even if you can't get a group to dress with you, I highly suggest dressing up like your favorite cast member from "Saved By The Bell." Not only will you get loads of compliments, you'll also win all of the contests. I'll bet my money on it!</p><p>If you need reference, here's a photo to inspire you:</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Here's what you need to dress up like Kelly, Jessie, and Lisa.</p><h3>Kelly Kapowski</h3><p>If you feel like dressing up like Bayside's sweetheart, make sure to stick to crop tops and big hair. Kelly always had the cutest outfits, so make sure to keep it playful and fun. Oh, and super important — don't forget the prints and neons.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><i>(Kendra Scott Blazing Yellow Danielle Earrings, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>renttherunway.com</a>, $60)</i></p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><i>(Floral Sunrise Cropped Top Clover Canyon, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>revolveclothing.com</i></a><i>, $115)</i></p><h3>Jessie Spano</h3><p>The smarty pants of the crew definitely had some serious style, too. Dress up like Jessie by adding lots of big curls, denim, and a headband.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><i>(MOTO Authentic Blue Mom Jeans, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>us.topshop.com</a>, $70)</i></p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><i>(ASOS Contemporary Pastel Print Oversized Shirt, </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>asos.com</i></a><i>, $65)</i></p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><i>Blue Bandana Headband, $5,<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> icing.com</a></i></p><h3>Lisa Turtle</h3><p>OK, so Lisa was obviously the fashionista of the group. If you're going to dress up like Ms. Turtle, it's completely necessary to make sure you've got your '90s style down. Add a lot of texture and multiple layers. Also, pack on the accessories.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><i>(Costume National Oversized Chain Detail Belt, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>farfetch.com</a>, $256.05)</i></p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><i>(MOTO Washed Black Western Jacket, us.topshop.com, $75)</i></p><figure class="Qf5 nbP"></figure><p><i>(Leopard Dress, $48, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>shoptiques.com</a>)</i></p><p>BRB, while I go binge on <i>Saved By The Bell</i> reruns for inspo.</p><p><i>Images: Saved By The Bell/NBC; Courtesy of Brands</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyfZNvcHJllZbAunnSmq2enF2Xxm7Ax55km52coXqprculprCdlaN6pLvSraymnaNisrex0bJkcmijYriqsIywoKWkXaG8t7GMqZ%2BorJ%2Bo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
