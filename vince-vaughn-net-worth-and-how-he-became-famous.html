That year, he appeared in an episode of “21 Jump Street” titled “Mike’s P.O.V.” in which he played the character Bill Peterson. Vaughn secured his first credited movie role when he played Jamie O’Hara in the 1993 film “Rudy.”</p><p id=par-3_53>Vaughn got his big break after starring in Steven Spielberg’s 1997 film “The Lost World: Jurassic Park.” He played the character Nick Van Owen. That year, he appeared in another film titled “The Locusts.” Vaughn’s other acting roles include appearances in “Seberg,” “F is for Family,” “Fighting with My Family,” “True Detective,” “The Internship,” and “Couples Retreat.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Vince Vaughn’s work outside of acting</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Vince-Vaughn-event.jpg><p id=par-4_52>Outside of acting, Vaughn has credits as a producer and writer.

He <a href=#>told</a> the “Orlando Sentinel,” he was turned down for many roles before he finally hit his stride. Two movie roles he was turned down for are “School Ties” and “Dazed and Confused.” Vaughn said he was very close to getting these parts, but it didn’t work out. “I almost got ‘School Ties,’ but Brendan Fraser got it,” said Vaughn. “I was very close to the final callback on ‘Dazed and Confused.’” Vaughn told the publication it was “devastating” to get so close to snagging these roles only to be rejected. “It’s such a hard process to get to that point. If it goes against you, then it’s like, ‘Oh, I’ve got to go through this whole process again.’”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Controversy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Donald-Trump-Melania-Trump.jpg><p id=par-6_70>Vaughn caused quite a stir when he was <a href=#>seen</a> shaking Donald Trump’s hand and speaking to him and <a href=#>Melania Trump</a> briefly at a college football national championship game. Some people on social media immediately called for Vaughn to be “cancelled” after a video of him chatting with the Trumps began circulating.
