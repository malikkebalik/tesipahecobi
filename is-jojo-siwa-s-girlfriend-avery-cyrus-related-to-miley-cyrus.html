Her ‘Dance Moms’ breakout, sexual orientation, and recent breakup</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-3_64>Siwa first rose to fame after appearing on the fourth season of Lifetime’s hit reality series, Dance Moms. She released her singles “Boomerang” and “I Can Make U Dance.” After departing the show halfway through its sixth season, Siwa signed a consumer deal with Nickelodeon, which led to her appearances in the film Blurt! and the show Lip Sync Battle Shorties with Nick Cannon.</p><p id=par-4_60>In the following years, <a href=#>Siwa embarked</a> on her first major concert tour in 2019: D.R.E.A.M. The Tour. She was scheduled to visit a mixture of theaters, outdoor amphitheaters, stadiums, and indoor arenas in 52 cities across the U.S. and Canada. Impressively, she was included on Time‘s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world in September 2020.</p><p id=par-5_33>Today, Siwa has over 10 million subscribers with over 2.4 billion views on YouTube, and over 11 million followers on Instagram.

When asked what her label was by a fan, Siwa explained she did not label her sexuality, as she “didn’t really know this answer” at the time. However, she’s since gone on to say the label she identifies with the most is pansexual.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_42>The internet was quick to rally behind the singer-dancer in support after she announced that she was dating <a href=#>her longtime friend Kylie Prew</a>. Siwa and Prew continued dating on and off until June 2022, when they confirmed they had called it quits.</p><p id=par-8_53>Ever since coming out as gay, Siwa has gone on to make history. She participated in season 30 of Dancing with the Stars, where <a href=#>she and partner Jenna Johnson</a> marked the show’s first-ever same-sex couple.
