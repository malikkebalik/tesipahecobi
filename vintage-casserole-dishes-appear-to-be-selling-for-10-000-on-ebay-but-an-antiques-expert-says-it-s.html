He said there are a few signs that the prices aren't accurate.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Signs of an inaccurate sale price, according to an expert. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText><a href=# class="image-source-link not-content-link" data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel="nofollow sponsored noindex" data-am-orig-url="https://affiliate.insider.com/?h=9bb1b6be26837f07b1c8b6e3b2e7fdaebb96f4077fc7704c94438a9ec0d4cb23&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2F">eBay</a></span></span></figure><p>Any listing with an even selling price like $6,000 or $4,000 probably didn't sell for that amount, Zimmerman said. Authentic sales are usually uneven numbers due to multiple bidders. If the listing doesn't show that there were any bidders at all, that's another red flag.</p><p>"I'm pretty sure if you look into it it's all manipulated numbers," he said. "You want to see multiple bids or non-even numbers. If you see a number like $10,000 with 22 bidders it's most likely real. But if it says 'best offer accepted,' you'll never know what the best offer is. "</p><p>Zimmerman said that's why eBay can be an unreliable source for determining the value of an antique. If a seller lists an item for $6,000, but accepts a "best offer" that's much lower, eBay doesn't share what that offer was — it will still show that the item sold for the price originally listed.</p><p>"If someone's asking for that number and they take the best offer, you'll never actually know what the offer is," he said. "That's why eBay is tricky. It's a good resource, but people get confused."</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Signs of a legitimate sale. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText><a href=# class="image-source-link not-content-link" data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel="nofollow sponsored noindex" data-am-orig-url="https://affiliate.insider.com/?h=e3c9a8b90700cfd5f14247457a7694eb47641ee48c7626d320953dbfb4cb62ad&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_from%3DR40%26_nkw%3Dvintage%2Bcorningware%26_sacat%3D0%26LH_Sold%3D1%26LH_Complete%3D1%26_sop%3D16%26_pgn%3D5">eBay</a></span></span></figure><p>He sees this happen a lot at Syl-Lee Antiques. People come in and want to sell their items for the inflated prices they found online, only to discover that they're actually worth much less.</p><p>"It's a tough thing, I see it all the time," he said.
