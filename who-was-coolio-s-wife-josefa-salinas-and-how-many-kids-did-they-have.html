Capt. Erik Scott of the Los Angeles Fire Department&nbsp;explained to the publication that firefighters and paramedics found Coolio unresponsive. They performed “resuscitation efforts for approximately 45 minutes,” but to no avail.</p><p id=par-3_25>“We are saddened by the loss of our dear friend and client, Coolio, who passed away this afternoon,” Coolio’s talent manager Sheila Finegan told CNN.</p><p id=par-4_48>So, did Coolio have a wife at the time of his death? It seems he died without a spouse, though he was married in the past to a woman named Josefa Salinas. Salinas and Coolio tied the knot in 1996, and they divorced four years later in 2000.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who was Coolio’s wife, Josefa Salinas?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Coolios-wife-Josefa-Salinas-1.jpg><p id=par-5_26><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sun</a> reports that Coolio’s wife, Josefa Salinas, met <a href=#>the “Gangsta’s Paradise” rapper</a> in 1987.
