In the first verse, Durk is heard saying:</p><p class=paragraph-text>"N***as&nbsp;acting like they really like that since my brodie died (Von) /Just got out the feds, you bring up murders with your police a**".</p><p class=paragraph-text>'AHHH HA' also takes a dig at YoungBoy's ex-girlfriend Jania Meshell, who was romantically related to King Von. "I warned Von to stay away from that bitch because she posts on OnlyFans" Durk continues.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.ytimg.com/vi/k-PaOWxvnz0/hqdefault.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>NBA YoungBoy - I Hate YoungBoy</p><p class=paragraph-text>YoungBoy seemingly responded by dropping a diss track named 'I Hate YoungBoy', where he not only takes aim at Durk but also Durk's fiancée India, Gucci Mane and King Von. He also name-dropping&nbsp;King Von’s alleged murderer Quando Rondo in the song.</p><p class=paragraph-text>"Quando got no filter, and he say that, they gon’ fuck with ‘em / Clean up on aisle O, youngin let that chop blow / Ayy, my brother let that stick blow, n***a know that’s my smoke /&nbsp;He called me a b***h, that’s India, that be your ho" he raps in the beginning off the diss.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>NBA Youngboy done dissed on this one song...

He rapped, "Ni**a, this that Squid Game, O'Block pack get wrapped up / Murder what they said, Atlanta dude get fold up".</p><p class=paragraph-text>The cause behind Lil Durk and NBA YoungBoy's apparent dispute could be due to their close friendship circle.</p><p class=paragraph-text>King Von was shot and died following an incident with associates of Quando Rondo, who is signed to YoungBoy's Never Broke Again record label. NBA YoungBoy – whose real name is Kentrell DeSean Gaulden – had a close bond with Quando Rondo.</p><figure>NBA YoungBoy performs during Lil WeezyAna at Champions Square on August 25, 2018 in New Orleans, Louisiana. <span class=attribution>Picture: <a href=#>Getty</a></span></figure><h2 class=heading-subtitle><a href=#><strong><span class=underline>Here Are All The Ways You Can Listen To Capital XTRA</span></strong></a></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pK3PoquapKipv6J6wqikaKaVrMBwuMilZJ2toqB6r67AZrCorZ6cr7DFjJucnp5dmsWxuMCipZ6cXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
