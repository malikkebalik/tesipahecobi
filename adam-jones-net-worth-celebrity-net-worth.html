He began working as a special effects designer with a concentration in stop-motion techniques (which would later be seen in Tool's music videos for "Sober", "Prison Sex" and more).</p><p>Upon graduating from art school he went to work at a Character Shop where he fabricated makeup and costumes. He designed and fabricated works that would be seen in movies such as Jurassic Park, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Predator 2, Dances with Wolves, and Ghostbusters 2. He also worked as a set designer.

They soon added drummer <a href=#>Danny Carey</a> and bass player Paul D'Amour, who was eventually replaced by <a href=#>Justin Chancellor</a>.</p><p>Tool's debut album "Undertow" was released in 1993. "Undertow" went platinum within a year and soon after, Tool attracted controversy with their music video, "Prison Sex", which was pulled from MTV because of its graphic nature.

Five years later, the group got together again for their third album, "Lateralus", and later released their fourth effort, "10,000 Days," in 2006. In August 2019 Tool announced that their fifth album "Fear Inoculum", their first album in 13 years, would be released on August 30, 2019.</p><p>Outside of Tool Adam has contributed to the band <a href=# title="Jello Biafra Net Worth">Jello Biafra</a>/The Melvin's albums Never Breathe What You Can't See and Sieg Howdy!
