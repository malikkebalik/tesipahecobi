The show is also popular for its well-choreographed martial arts fight scenes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_46><a href=#>Playing volatile teenager Tory</a>, who’s full of sass and trying to win Miguel’s heart, List came in about halfway through the second season.
