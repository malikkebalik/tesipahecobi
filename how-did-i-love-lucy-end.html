He was 5 years old when he began playing the Ricardos’ son. In a conversation with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Television Academy Foundation</a>, the actor recalled his last visit, along with his wife and daughter, with Lucille Ball.</p><p id=par-4_72>“This is typical Lucy: She’s standing at the end of her hall, it’s about 50 feet down. She’s not greeting me at the door, she’s way down by the staircase, she’s got her hands wide open. Like, ‘Come to me!’” Thibodeaux said as he laughed at the memory. “There was this big hug, Lucy when she hugged you she just squeezed the life out of you. We spent a good hour there.”</p><p id=par-5_16>The Louisiana-born percussionist recalled how it saddened him to see that his former boss was alone.</p><p id=par-6_52>“It was kind of sad because it was her birthday and there was nobody there on her birthday,” he said. “She was by herself. I really thought it was a good thing that we were there. It was just cool. She said, ‘I hear good things about you, I’m proud of you.’”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-the-final-episode-of-i-love-lucy-was-another-day-in-lucy-s-world>The final episode of ‘I Love Lucy’ was another day in Lucy’s world</h2><p id=par-7_52>During the sixth season, the Ricardos and the Mertzes made Connecticut their home. The Ricardos first moved to the Constitution state by the 16th episode that season, “Lucy Hates to Leave”; by the 19th episode, “Lucy Raises Chickens,” the Mertzes have pulled up stakes, left New York City, and joined them.</p><p id=par-8_64>Episode 27 of the season turned out to be the series’ finale, although it may not have been known at the time to anyone, even to Ball or Arnaz. And so, I Love Lucy‘s last episode had no emotional farewells or even a concluding storyline wrapping up the previous five seasons. It was another episode featuring Ball in her element, and it was anticlimactic.</p><p id=par-9_69>“On April 4, 1957, they filmed the last I Love Lucy in the half-hour format, “The Ricardos Dedicate a Statue,” in which Lucy wrecks the town’s memorial to a Revolutionary War soldier,” Kathleen Brady wrote in her biography of Ball, Lucille: The Life of Lucille Ball. “She passes herself off as a stone sculpture for the unveiling until a dog—one of the many animals that loved Lucy—licks her face.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=en dir=ltr>On October 15, 1951, "I Love Lucy" premiered on CBS and began its storied journey into the collective hearts of generations of fans as one of the most popular television shows of all time.

Desi got so caught up in the plot that he let it run to 75 minutes and then convinced U.S. Steel to shorten its program, which followed, so the entire episode could be aired. The Lucy-Desi special ran on Wednesday, November 6, 1957, and helped propel The U.S. Steel Hour to its highest rating ever.”</p><p id=par-12_24>After 13 episodes, The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour ended in 1960, along with Ball and Arnaz’s marriage with their divorce on May 4 that year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1sMOMnaCdZZliubDCxGajrpupYrKvsI2hq6akXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
