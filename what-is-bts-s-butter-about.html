It talks about an attraction between two people, but other than that, BTS is not hiding anything deeper among the lyrics.</p><p id=par-9_60>“If you hear the title ‘Butter,’ you know immediately that we tried to prepare a song that’s easy listening, instead of [something with] a really heavy or profound message,” Jimin said “This is a little embarrassing, but it’s something smooth like butter, that really melts into and grabs hold of you. It’s a very cute song, sort of a confession.”</p><p id=par-10_26>Jungkook also added, “‘Butter’ is very simple. It’s getting warmer and will get hotter, and we hope that you can spend a fun summer with BTS.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bts-often-writes-songs-about-meaningful-topics>BTS often writes songs about meaningful topics</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_22>While BTS occasionally releases fun songs like “Butter” and “Dynamite,” the group also has a reputation for writing hard-hitting tracks as well.</p><p id=par-12_86>When BTS was formed, the group was originally meant to be a hip-hop ensemble that made music for young people. As a result, BTS often write lyrics about social issues that the youths of both South Korea and the world can relate to. For example, some songs talk about the expectations placed on young people by adults around them. Others touch on the subject of mental health and the struggle to find happiness. At the heart of it, BTS often shares messages of hope and self-acceptance.</p><p id=par-13_52>HYBE’s CEO, Bang Si-Hyuk, believes this is a factor in BTS’s immense success. He told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Time Magazine</a>, “They don’t shy away from speaking about the pain felt by today’s generation. They respect diversity and justice, the rights of youths and marginalized people. I think all of these factors worked in their favor.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZqCsZZKpwLR5wa6rrZ2iYq6ju9StZaGsnaF8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
