His ancestry traces back to Belarus and Poland. Interested in fashion design from an early age, Posen would steal yarmulkes from his grandparents' synagogue to create ball dresses for dolls. He was educated at Saint Ann's School, a private school in Brooklyn, and during his sophomore year interned for fashion designer Nicole Miller. At the age of 16, Posen did a pre-college program at the Parsons School of Design.
