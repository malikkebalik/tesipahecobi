No, but really, the <a href=# class=T3D>first day of winter</a> is quickly approaching, as the 2018 winter solstice falls on Dec. 21. In the Northern Hemisphere, this means that we are officially beginning a few months of colder weather that equals snowstorms, freezing rain, and probably a lot of travel delays. <a href=# class=T3D>Winter can be a rough season</a> to get through, thanks to the fact that the sun is basically nonexistent, temperatures are so low that it actually hurts to be outside, and it kind of feels like you're stuck inside all the time, which gets boring. At the same time, there's nothing you can do about it, so why not just embrace it? You can start by laughing at some first day of winter memes that truly capture the spirit of the day.</p><p>Again, there are plenty of negative things about winter, and you could let those things really get you down, but... what's the point? Yeah, it stinks to be cold all the time, and it's not fun to have to deal with things getting cancelled because of the weather, and no one really loves wearing a pile of layers instead of, you know, a cute outfit, but at the same time, we have to just learn to deal. One of the ways you can do that is by laughing at these relatable winter memes and realizing that you aren't the only one who may be feeling a little down in the dumps about the latest season change. It can actually be really helpful to laugh about this stuff with other people!</p><p>Plus, the winter solstice is a great time to sit back, take things slow, relax, and reflect on your journey so far. Maybe you can take some time to meditate and feel more calm, or maybe you can manage to embrace the extra darkness on the day of the year we get the least amount of sun. The winter solstice has so many important meanings that go back centuries, so it's definitely worth looking into.</p><p>And, hey, maybe you actually enjoy winter and everything that comes with it. That means you're in a much better spot than everyone who is counting down the days until the first day of spring (which isn't for a very long time, unfortunately). Either way, you'll enjoy the below memes, which are totally ridiculous yet also completely relatable:</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">1</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">You start off optimistic before you remember what winter is really like:</h2></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">2</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Your go-to outfit quickly becomes just a pile of layers.</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">3</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">You're pretty convinced it's been winter for the last few weeks.</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">4</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">It gets dark so early that you don't even understand time anymore.</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.memecdn.com/winter-is-coming-and-jon-snow-too-if-you-know-what-i-mean_o_6082145.jpg><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">6</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Honestly, you're considering joining the bears.</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.memecdn.com/winter_o_4187495.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.memecdn.com/winter-time_o_2694897.jpg><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">9</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Yeah, basically:</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">10</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">You know you're complaining a lot, but what else are you supposed to do?!</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.memecdn.com/winter-is-loading_o_6123635.jpg><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">12</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">The cold seats are the worst.</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">13</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">This is the best thing about winter:</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure></figure><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jmpqZp6Zp8C1ecOasGanlmLEqrrTnqlmamBmhW65xKacrGWkpHqpscupZLCZoqJ6urvUq2Ssp6Wheqe%2BzqZkraCVYrCwuMNmrp6ZpJ2ys3mQbmxubWlmfw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
