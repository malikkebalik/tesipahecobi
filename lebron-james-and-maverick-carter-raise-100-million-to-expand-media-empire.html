He's done plenty for his local communities, including opening up the I Promise School in Akron, Ohio. The school teaches STEM subjects to elementary school students, particularly at-risk children. His business empire continues to grow, too, from endorsements and investments to a more recent focus on media.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That last bucket received a big boost after James and longtime business partner <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Maverick Carter</a> raised $100 million to expand their brand into a large media conglomerate. Investors include Guggenheim Investments, UC Investments, Sister Investments, and SC Holdings.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>SpringHill Entertainment will include multiple divisions, most notably Uninterrupted. This is the athlete empowerment media and consumer product company James has promoted through episodes with other players. SpringHill Entertainment will also feature a culture brand agency Robot Company and a production company.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-302750 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GettyImages-1066599734.jpg alt width=900 height=693 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-302750 class=wp-caption-text>Harry How/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>According to </span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=font-weight:400>Bloomberg Businessweek</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>, the deal closed on March 11 – the same day the NBA halted its season after Utah Jazz center <a href=# title="Rudy Gobert Net Worth">Rudy Gobert</a> tested positive for coronavirus.
