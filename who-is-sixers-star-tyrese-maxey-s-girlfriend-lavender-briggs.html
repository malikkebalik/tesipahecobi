Maxey’s minutes were limited in his rookie season. However, Ben Simmons’ refusal to play for the team the following season gave Maxey an opportunity to become the Sixers <a href=#>starting&nbsp;point guard</a>.</p><p id=par-2_60>Since then, Maxey has really elevated his game. He made his first All-Star team in 2024 before being named the&nbsp;NBA’s Most Improved Player. Now that he’s gained popularity and recognition outside the City of Brotherly Love, fans are trying to learn about his life off the court too including who he’s dating. Here’s more on Maxey’s girlfriend Lavender Briggs.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-briggs-is-an-athlete-as-well>Briggs is an athlete as well</h2><p id=par-3_19>Briggs was born on June 23, 2001, in Newburgh, New York. She has two older brothers, Darrian and Stefan.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_44>When Briggs was 7 years old, her family relocated to Utah. She attended Mountain View High School just outside Salt Lake City where she played on the basketball team. After two years, she transferred to Provo High School and played for that team.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Lavender-Briggs-of-the-Maryland-Terrapins-handles-the-ball-against-the-Syracuse-Orange-1.jpg><p id=par-5_69>In 2019, Briggs committed to the Florida Gators as one of the top-ranked recruits in the country. There, she was named SEC Freshman of the Week and acquired a spot on the All-SEC team in 2020. But a foot injury sidelined her for the final eight games of her sophomore season. She would then miss the majority of her junior season with a stress fracture in her left shin.</p><p id=par-6_40>Briggs made the decision to switch schools and enrolled in the University of Maryland to play for the Terrapins.&nbsp;Her last game with the team was in February 2024 when she suffered a season-ending&nbsp;knee injury against Rutgers, concluding her collegiate career.</p><p id=par-7_40>When asked to define herself and her time as a student-athlete, the&nbsp;6-foot-1 guard told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Diamondback</a>: &nbsp;“I would probably describe Lavender Briggs as someone who never gave up. She got dealt a hard hand and she just never gave up.”</p><p id=par-8_44>Briggs earned a Bachelor’s degree in sociology before pursuing an MBA from the Robert H. Smith School of Business. According to her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a>, she has “developed great communication, leadership, and teamwork skills through playing college basketball that are transferrable to my future corporate position.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-maxey-and-briggs-have-kept-their-relationship-details-under-wraps>Maxey and Briggs have kept their relationship details under wraps</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/L-Tyrese-Maxey-of-the-Philadelphia-76ers-R-Lavender-Briggs-of-the-Maryland-Terrapins-1.jpg><p id=par-9_27>Maxey and Briggs reportedly began dating sometime in 2022, but they kept their relationship under wraps and have only been seen together a handful of times.</p><p id=par-10_32>Neither have spoken about their relationship publicly and they don’t share photos of each other on their social media pages, indicating that they want to keep things as private as possible.</p><p id=par-11_25>Fans are hopeful though that they may see Briggs taking in a 76ers game at some point to cheer on her beau in person.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAqsTEq6pmq6SWv27A2KucrJ1doq65sdhmnqKqnJu%2FqrHNnWSlmaaau6Wx0WaZq6GXnMBvtNOmo2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
