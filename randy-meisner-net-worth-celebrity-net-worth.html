The Eagles went on to become an incredibly successful band. He performed with the group for their first six years, recording and writing some of their most popular songs, before returning to Nebraska to be with his family. He also enjoyed a moderately successful solo career.</p><p>On July 27, 2023, Randy Meisner died at the age of 77.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Meisner was born on March 8, 1946 in Scottsbluff, Nebraska. He was the second son to Herman and Emilie Meisner, who worked as farmers growing corn, beans, alfalfa, and sugar beets on their family farm.. All four of his grandparents were Volga German immigrants. Meisner and his older sister, Emilie, helped their parents on the farm in their youth. He developed an interest in the guitar when he was ten years old and started taking lessons and later played in local bands. While he was attending Scottsbluff High School, one of his teachers suggested he start learning how to play the bass. For Meisner, his love of R&B and Motown music made the switch easy and he often was able to just make up bass parts while accompanying other musicians.</p><h2 id=early-career><strong>Early Career</strong></h2><p>Meisner was part of the local band, The Dynamics, from 1961 until 1965. They played in various local venues and then released their first record, a 4-song EP, in 1962 in which Meisner sang lead vocals. They signed record deal with Sully Records out of Amarillo Texas in 1965.</p><p>Meisner then left the group and moved to California where he joined a band named The Soul Survivors, which later was renamed The Poor. The band released several singles in the mid to late-1960s but was making very little money for most of their time together. They experienced some success when they were booked for two weeks at the Salvation Club in New York City where they opened for The <a href=# title="Jimi Hendrix Net Worth">Jimi Hendrix</a> Experience. However, the experience was not the opportunity the band had hoped for and they had to bargain with their managers in order to get money for plane tickets back to L.A.</p><p>In May of 1968, Meisner briefly joined the group Poco but then left before the group released their first album. The next year, he joined Rick Nelson's Stone Canyon Band. He appears on a number of the bands tracks and albums but ultimately decided to leave the band after a tour with them in Europe in 1970.

Meisner's main role in the band was that of bass player and backing vocalist, though he also co-wrote and sang lead on a number of songs in the groups first five albums.</p><p>The Eagles went on to become one of the most iconic rock bands of the time. In their time together, the produced six number-one albums, won six Grammy Awards, and five American Music Awards. After a number of successful albums, they released "Their Greatest Hits" in 1976 which became the best-selling album in the United States, selling over 38 million copies. Some of their most popular tracks include "Take It Easy," "One of These Nights," "Take It to the Limit," and "Hotel California," among many others.</p><p>Meisner's time in the Eagles was sometimes troubled, as he felt torn between the band and spending time with his family. He also was often involved in band in-fighting and became sick during the band's rigorous touring schedule following the release of "Hotel California." After one show in Knoxville, Meisner decided not to join the band for an encore as he had caught the flew. This led to an angry altercation with Glenn Frey and resulted in Meisner being frozen out of the band.</p><p>Meisner formally quite the Eagles in September of 1977, citing exhaustion, and he was replaced by Timothy Schmit. From that point onward, Meisner primarily released solo albums and created Randy Meisner & the Silverados, which he toured with throughout the early 1980s. In 1985, he became part of the all-star band, Black Tie.</p><p>Meisner was excluded from the Eagles' 1994 comeback tour, which he was disappointed about, but did join all past and present members of the band when they were inducted into the Rock and Rock Hall of Fame in 1998. He later was invited to take part in the History of the Eagles world tour in 2013 but declined due to health issues.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-277224 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/rm-1.jpg alt width=442 height=340 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-277224 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Meisner was married twice.
