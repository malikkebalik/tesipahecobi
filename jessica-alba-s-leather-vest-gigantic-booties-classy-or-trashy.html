Looking miserable, as always. Even when she smiles, she still looks like she’s hating something. Maybe she just has one of those faces? When I’m not smiling or something, I’ve been told my natural expression is “bitchy”. Perhaps Alba’s is “glum”. Anyway, Jessica wore a simple black dress, but she dressed it up a bit with a leather vest (which I like), lots of chunky jewelry (too much) and these hideous booties. Now, I wore my far share of clogs when I was younger. I recognize a “fancy” clog when I see them. These are being described as booties, but they have the soul of clogs.</p><p>And a word about the makeup – the dark look does nothing for her. Dark eyes, dark lips, and are her eyebrows filled in? It’s all too much.</p><p>Anyway, as I was trying to find anything else related to Alba, I found these comments she made recently, probably as some early promotion for her work in Robert Rodriguez’s Machete (with Lindsay Lohan!). Alba is trying to backtrack on <a href=#>some comments she made in February</a>, saying the best thing about being famous is, “making lots of money has made me happy. No one else helped me — I’ve done this all by my self, on my own terms. My dad’s also turned his real-estate business around and doing really well, and my brother acts, models and does mortgages, so we’ve all come up in the world. Anyone out there who gets bullied should realize that they can take control of their lives and succeed.” Now she’s singing a different tune, playing the “I’m an artist, it’s not about the money” card. HA!</p><p>Jessica Alba’s previous film choices have been informed by money.</p><p>The 28-year-old actress – who has had starting roles in ‘Fantastic Four’, ‘Never Been Kissed’ and ‘Sin City’ – admits she now wants to take on movie role she wouldn’t have done before the birth of her daughter Honor in June 2008.</p><p>She said: “When I took the time off I decided that if I’m going to do this for a living it has to be good filmmakers, good characters and doing stuff that I’m not always comfortable with.”</p><p>“I want to do stuff I’m afraid of doing, because I felt like my choices previously were motivated by commerce. I was doing what I could to create a base with an audience, in each territory, that would help me stay relevant.”</p><p>One such film is her new movie ‘Machete’ by Robert Rodriguez, which Alba describes as “old school”.</p><p>She told Total Film magazine: “It looks bada*s! It’s sort of going back to old school Robert… ‘El Mariachi’, ‘From Dusk Till Dawn’, ‘Desperado’. It’s very smart and very cool. I get to play twins!”</p><p>‘Machete’ – which also stars Lindsay Lohan and Michelle Rodriguez – is set for release this year.</p><p>[From <a href=#>Contact Music</a>]</p><p>I would buy it if Alba was an artist, or had any discernable talent other than looking cute on a red carpet. But she’s a terrible actress – FX keeps playing those Fantastic Four movies, and she’s is really, really bad in them. But she’s an artist now! So, you know, look out Meryl Streep. Chuckle.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/wenn2809565.jpg alt=wenn2809565 title=wenn2809565 width=580 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Jessica in LA on April 15, 2010.
