Park moved to Canada with her family when she was a baby and spent the majority of her upbringing there, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb</a>.</p><p id=par-3_67>At a young age, Park felt an affinity for the entertainment business, but she didn’t kickstart her career until she was around 25 years old. That was the year that Park was cast in the Canadian teen drama series Edgemont. From there, Park moved swiftly up the ladder of success in the acting world, landing high-profile roles in TV shows such as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlestar Galactica and</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Hawaii Five-0</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_58>A few other series that Park appeared in include Dark Angel, Stargate SG-1, Jake 2.0, The Dead Zone, and Human Cargo.

Featuring the story of a tight-knit group of friends based in Boston, the show has helped introduce Park to a whole new audience of fans.

While <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV Series Finale</a> reports there is no word on whether the fan-favorite show has been renewed for a fifth season, it’s clear that Park wouldn’t mind returning to the show for another season. As she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a> in a 2018 interview, she was very “moved” after she read the script.</p><p id=par-8_43>“These characters weren’t really living the lives they needed to live,” Park said. “That struck a strong chord with me. From the outside, people may think, ‘Oh, she’s really living the life she wants!’…I feel like I’m so far away from doing that.”</p><p id=par-9_52>She also praised the group mentality of her fellow cast members on the show, noting: “We all have the same trailers, the same treatment. We don’t necessarily have the same salaries, because people came from all different places (in their careers), but maybe we’ll be at parity in a few years.”</p><p id=par-10_29>For Park, who has worked hard for decades to create characters people can relate to, this next phase of her career is proving to be the most exciting yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZqCsZZenrqSxjKmYq6Ndo7K1edaoqa2gXp3BrriO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
