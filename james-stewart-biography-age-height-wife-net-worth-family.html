In his first year playing for the Lions, Stewart rushed for a career-high 1,184 yards and 10 touchdowns. In 2001, he rushed for 685 yards and one touchdown. During the 2002 season, he had another 1,000-plus yard season (1,021) and four touchdowns. He rushed for a career-high 172 yards in a 23-20 Week 7 victory over the Chicago Bears. He was, however, injured late in 2002 with a severe shoulder injury and did not play in 2003, ending his career. According to Coy Wire, Stewart's injury occurred because of a bounty system established by then Buffalo Bills head coach <a href=#>Gregg Williams</a>. Wire stated: "I shattered James Stewart's shoulder and he never played again. I was showered with praise for that. It's a shame that's how it was. Now I see how wrong that was."</p><p>Stewart was the second selection by the new expansion Jacksonville Jaguars with the 19th pick of the first round in the 1995 NFL Draft. Stewart would play solidly for the Jaguars in his five season with the team. In his rookie season, Stewart led the Jaguars in rushing with 525 yards and also had two rushing touchdowns. He would lead the team again in 1996 with 723 yards and eight touchdowns. He finished the 1997 season with 555 yards and eight touchdowns, however he finished second on the team that year in rushing yards behind teammate <a href=#>Natrone Means</a>. Stewart still holds the franchise record for the most points in a single game (30) and for the most rushing touchdowns in a game (5). Both these records were obtained on October 12, 1997 in a 38-21 Week 7 win over the Philadelphia Eagles. The Jaguars drafted <a href=#>Fred Taylor</a> as their new franchise back in 1998 and, as a result, Stewart only rushed for 217 yards and two touchdowns.
