Since we’ve heard that <strong>Taylor Swift</strong> is still <a rel=nofollow href=#>not really over</a> <strong>Harry Styles</strong>, we can either assume that Taylor is <a rel=nofollow href=#>using new boy toy <strong>Brenton Thwaites</strong></a> to get Harry jealous, or she’s using Brenton as a replacement for Harry.</p><p>I mean, look at Brenton – apart from the curly hair, he’s practically Harry’s spitting image. Foreign (British/Australian = close enough for American Taylor) cute, twee, and with an adorable dimple. Curl his hair, and you have Harry Styles 2.0.</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#><img decoding=async title="Taylor Swift Dating Harry Styles' Twin, Brenton Thwaites - See The Similarities - Taylor Wants Another Harry!

So there is a possibility that Taylor thinks she can get him back, and is trying to make him jealous by flaunting her relationship to Brenton. Well, not relationship, but hookup/flirtation/whatever that was.</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#><img decoding=async alt=brendon_thwaites_harry_styles src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebdirtylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/brendon_thwaites_harry_styles.jpg width=500 height=333 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Even though Taylor and Brenton have only been publicly spotted together once, there are already rumors that they’re getting serious. It’s Taylor Swift, so this shouldn’t be surprising to anyone who’s followed her relationships in the past. But if she’s still trying to get over Harry, I pity Brenton if she decides to transfer her intensity to him. Taylor has a tendency to get very serious, very fast, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they became inseparable within a couple of weeks. And when the inevitable breakup comes, we’ll be treated to yet another song about how Brenton broke her heart, and how she’s decided to take a break from dating.</p><p>I do have to give her kudos that she’s lasted this long without dating someone. There were reports coming out right after Taylor broke up with Harry that she was going to do some <a rel=nofollow href=#>damage control for her image</a>, and refuse to date anyone for a year. While she didn’t last a whole year, she lasted for several months – and that’s an achievement all by itself.</p><p><a rel=nofollow href=#><img decoding=async title="Taylor Swift Dating Harry Styles' Twin, Brenton Thwaites - See The Similarities - Taylor Wants Another Harry!

Do you think Taylor’s still not over Harry, and is using Brenton as a replacement? Or is she trying to make Harry jealous, even if there’s a really low probability that will work.
