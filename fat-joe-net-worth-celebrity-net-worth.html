As a businessperson, Fat Joe has been involved in a variety of entrepreneurial endeavors, including a sneaker store in New York City and a podcast where he interviews other artists and celebrities.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Fat Joe's real name is Joseph Antonio Cartagena. He was born on August 19th of 1970 in the South Bronx neighborhood of New York City. Cartagena is of Cuban and Puerto Rican descent. Because he grew up in a rough, impoverished neighborhood, Cartagena was driven to a life of crime at an early age. He described himself as a "bully" during his school years, and he often stole in order to support his family. At a young age, Joseph's brother introduced him to his true passion in life: Hip-Hop music.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In 1992, Cartagena took the stage name "Fat Joe da Gangster" and joined the Diggin' in the Crates Crew (D.I.T.C). During this time, he had the chance to collaborate with a range of artists, making valuable networking connections that he would later use to build his record label. He was first signed to Relativity Records, and in 1993 he was ready to release his debut album.</p><p>Represent was Fat Joe's first solo album, and it contained the hit "Flow Joe." The track reached the top spot on the Rap Charts and helped Fat Joe kick off his music career with a bang. In 1995, he followed up with his second album, Jealous One's Envy. The track "Envy" performed well on the charts, further solidifying Fat Joe's success. Things were taken a step further when he ran into <a href=# title="LL Cool J Net Worth">LL Cool J</a> during a session at the recording studio. He was invited into the booth to record on the track "I Shot Ya," and later appeared in the music video.</p><p>During this period, Fat Joe also started working with <a href=# title="Big Pun Net Worth">Big Pun</a>, whom he personally discovered. In 1998, Fat Joe collaborated with artists such as Nas, Diddy, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony on his third album, Don Cartegena.

Although "We Thuggin'" was a major hit from the album, it was completely overshadowed by "What's Luv."

This all contributed to a level of success that Fat Joe would never again surpass with any other album â€“ including 2002's Loyalty. Eventually, Jealous Ones Still Envy achieved platinum certification.</p><h2 id=50-cent-feud><strong>50 Cent Feud</strong></h2><p>In 2004, Terror Squad released their last album, True Story.

Kelly</a>, <a href=# title="Eminem Net Worth">Eminem</a>, and Remy Ma.</p><p>His feud with 50 Cent eventually escalated, and Fat Joe publicly criticized 50 Cent for cowardice and a lack of street cred. Things reached a boiling point during the MTV Video Music Awards in 2005 when Fat Joe insulted 50 Cent while on stage, prompting the latter to jump onto the stage while yelling obscenities. The award show quickly cut to a commercial break.</p><p>Fat Joe then collaborated with <a href=# title="Lil Wayne Net Worth">Lil Wayne</a> on his seventh album, Me, Myself & I. This spawned the Grammy-nominated hit single "Make It Rain." The rivalry between 50 Cent and Fat Joe continued during this period. After Fat Joe released The Elephant in the Room, 50 Cent mocked this new album, claiming his mixtape sold more units and that he single-handedly "ended" Fat Joe's career.</p><p>During the next few years, Fat Joe continued to collaborate with a range of artists, releasing albums such as J.O.S.E. 2 and The Darkside Vol. 1.

He has lived in Miami and Tenafly, New Jersey.</p><p>Despite losing 88 pounds over the years, Fat Joe said he would not be changing his stage name as it would not be a good marketing move.</p><p>In 2022, Fat Joe bought a custom Rolls Royce Cullinan for $450,000.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2000, Joe paid $115,000 for an acre of land in Plantation, Florida, near Fort Lauderdale.
