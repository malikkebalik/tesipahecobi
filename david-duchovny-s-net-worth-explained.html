What started as a three-season contract paying $150,000 per episode morphed lucratively up to $240,000 per episode starting with season four.

Where did it all come from? Being an internationally famous film and television star certainly didn’t hurt. As we shared above, living life as the face of one of the biggest network <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV hits in the 1990s</a> definitely had its advantages, too.</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>Then there were the movies. X-Files: Fight the Future debuted in 1998, landing Duchovny a reported $4 million paycheck. The sequel, X-Files: I Want to Believe, hit theaters a decade later, adding $6 million to the star’s bank account. Business being business, Duchovny also sued the makers of The X-Files for cutting him out of the show’s profits and nabbed another $20 million for his efforts.</p><p data-characters=153 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>The success train continued, and Duchovny made an estimated $2.7 million per season for his Showtime series Californication, which ran from 2007 to 2014.</p><p data-characters=512 data-current-count=512 data-injectable=true>Massive fame gives, and massive fame takes away. In 2011, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Duchovny and his wife, Tea Leoni</a>, split after years of rocky business, with Duchovny having entered treatment for sex addiction in 2008. By 2014, their divorce was finalized, and Duchovny found himself with a $40,000 monthly spousal support payment to deal with, in addition to $8,000 of payments per month in child support. Based on his projected net worth, he’ll only be able to keep those payments up for 138 years before he needs to find more work.</p><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=77 data-injectable=false>So, as far as we’re concerned, he’s doing just fine for himself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SxosLInWSdrZOdvLe62Kxkp52kYsSwvtOhZJ6woKGuqrrEnWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
