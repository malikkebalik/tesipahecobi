Since being drafted in 2012, he's made not one, but two playoff series-winning shots. Off the court, Lillard is a talented rapper and a pillar in the Portland community. And after his newest deal, he's planning to stay Portland for quite some time.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Lillard and the Blazers have agreed to a four-year, $196 million super max extension. Lillard's massive deal includes a record-high player option in the final year worth $54.3 million.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The 28-year-old Lillard has two years and $61 million remaining on his current contract. This extension would keep him in Portland through the 2024-25 season.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Lillard has been the face of the franchise since <a href=# rel=noopener>LaMarcus Aldridge</a> signed with the San Antonio Spurs in 2015. He's led the Blazers to the playoffs six times, including the Western Conference Finals this year.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-283653 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/GettyImages-909023006.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-283653 class=wp-caption-text>Matthew Stockman/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Already, Lillard is the second-highest scorer in Blazers franchise history, behind just <a href=# rel=noopener>Clyde Drexler</a>. By the time this extension ends, he'll likely be No. 1 by far.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He's also one of just four players to average at least 25 points and five assists during the past four seasons. The others? <a href=# title="LeBron James Net Worth">LeBron James</a>, <a href=# title="Steph Curry Net Worth">Steph Curry</a>, and <a href=# title="James Harden Net Worth">James Harden</a>. Pretty good company to be in – and now Lillard is getting paid like them.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>NBA free agency is always a wild time, with plenty of big names and key role players switching teams. There was never much doubt Lillard would seek a new squad, but still, it's nice to feel secure. Expect to see plenty more good moments – both and off the court – for the next half-decade.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjp2YpqGRo3qttculmKucXZ%2FCtMCMrKCgppWZeqJ5zJqqrKGmmnqmxNOepayhn6N6qrrCpaydoZ6ceqJ50Z6aqKqUYsCmwNOipaBllp67oriMspyaql8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
