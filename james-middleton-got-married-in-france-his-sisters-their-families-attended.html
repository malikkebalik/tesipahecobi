They got engaged in September 2019, and they were supposed to get married in the summer of 2020, but they had to cancel/delay the wedding because of the pandemic. This weekend wedding didn’t come with a lot of hype, although I do think James and Alizee were planning it for months. They just didn’t leak everything to the Daily Mail, which is an interesting detail in itself. They ended up going to a lovely French village (Alizee is French) and they had a small family wedding there.</p><p>Apparently, James’ oldest sister made the trip to her brother’s wedding. The Duchess of Cambridge <a href=#>has not been seen in public in two full months</a> (since July 11), and there are already stories circulating that Kate is pregnant and trying to keep it on the DL. My theory is not a pregnancy though. My theory is that she and William have just been sorting out their separate living arrangements this summer. But according to the Daily Mail, William, Kate and their kids all made the trip to France for the wedding:</p><p>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took their children to the Cote d’Azur to see James Middleton marry his French fiancée at their secret wedding over the weekend, MailOnline can reveal today. Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis were with their parents Kate and Prince William to watch their uncle James wed Alizee Thevenet in the village of Bormes-les-Mimosas on Saturday.</p><p>But the future king and queen, and their royal children, weren’t the guests of honour – the couple’s dogs were – with golden retriever Mabel even photobombing the wedding pictures. Mr Middleton, 34, wrote on Instagram: ‘Yesterday I married the love of my life surrounded by family, friends and of course a few dogs.’</p><p>France is on the UK’s amber list so Kate and William, who are vaccinated, must get tested on or before the second day after returning. George and Charlotte also face a PCR test – but Louis, who is under 5, is exempt. The royal couple both attended the event, along with James’ other sister, socialite Pippa, and her businessman husband James Matthews. His parents Carole and Michael Middleton, and his beloved dogs, Luna and Mabel, are also thought to have watched them walk down the aisle.</p><p><a href=#>[From The Daily Mail]</a></p><p>Okay. Interesting (I guess) that Pippa and Terribly Moderately Wealthy James also made it to the wedding. There’s been some lowkey speculation that Pippa has actually tried to create some separation from the Middleton family. But I also get the impression that Kate and Pippa are both very protective of James, so obviously they would want to attend his wedding, even though it involves international travel in a pandemic and Brexit era. Would be very curious to hear about the vibe at the wedding, wouldn’t you? I hope Alizee has people around her whom she can trust, my goodness.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wenn34276620.jpg alt="The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle" width=480 sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CHRISTENIN_ZB68_319476_0014.jpg alt="Prince Louis christening" width=490 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wenn31483585.jpg alt="Middleton Matthews wedding" width=530 sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of James’s Instagram, Backgrid, WENN, Avalon Red.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcGtiaIV6e8mapJ6rj6K2pbDLnquopo%2BcvLWrzJqpq6GVmayqur6fqZqmk5qsqbXSmKqiq6Sav7Sr06GcoqqPm66utcuinKyXkanBprrDnpto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
