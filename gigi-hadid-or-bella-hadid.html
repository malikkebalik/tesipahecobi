The Hadid sisters started modeling at a young age. After turning 18, they both landed lucrative modeling contracts with&nbsp;luxury designers like Diane Von Furstenberg and Chanel.</p><p id=par-2_34>Gigi and Bella’s similarly <a href=#>successful careers</a> confuse some people. However, while they are both accomplished models, their journeys, degrees of success, and features — like their height — vary. So which sister is taller?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bella-hadid-wanted-to-be-an-olympian-equestrian>Bella Hadid wanted to be an Olympian equestrian</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-3_41>In a 2015 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Glamour</a>, Yolanda Foster (now Hadid), the mother of the two sisters, revealed that Bella was really into horses as a child. She wanted to be a professional equestrian and came close to competing in the Olympics.</p><p id=par-4_64>However, sickness cut Bella’s career with horses short when she received a Lyme disease diagnosis. Yolanda had her younger daughter cut back on riding for fear that she would get into an accident and injure herself. Bella took up modeling during this period. Her big break came in 2014 when she walked the runway for Spanish fashion label Desigual at New York Fashion Week.</p><p id=par-5_58>Bella’s sister Gigi’s passion for modeling was more evident from a young age. A <a href=#>Baby Guess ad campaign</a> featured her as a 2-year-old. However, Yolanda paused Gigi’s modeling gigs when she was nine years old to ensure she had a normal childhood <a href=#>without the judgment</a> that comes with modeling. Gigi, however, rejoined the modeling world after turning 17.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gigi-hadid-is-taller-than-bella-hadid-by-one-inch>Gigi Hadid is taller than Bella Hadid by one inch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1170405933.jpg><p id=par-6_46>While both sisters have enviable careers as models, Gigi is the more popular of the two by social media standards. On <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>, she outpaces Bella’s follower count by 22.9 million at the time of publication. Gigi has 72.7 million followers, and Bella has 49.8 million followers.</p><p id=par-7_47>Gigi has a net worth of <a href=#>$29 million</a>, while Bella is valued at <a href=#>$25 million</a>. Additionally, Gigi has been on more magazine covers than Bella. The 26-year-old even turns down requests to appear on top magazine covers so that other models receive a chance to promote themselves.</p><p id=par-8_25>Standing at 5’10,’ Gigi is one inch taller than her younger sister Bella, who stands at 5’9,’ which is the <a href=#>average height of female models</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gigi-and-bella-s-personal-lives>Gigi and Bella’s personal lives</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_74>Gigi and Bella’s successful careers have not come without criticism. While the two are certainly hardworking, critics point out that the sisters benefit <a href=#>from their mother’s connections</a> in the industry, given that Yolanda was a world-class model in the ’80s and ’90s. Gigi and Bella’s father is a wealthy real-estate developer, which adds to the perception that their success came easily. Other fans, however, point out that privilege can only take you so far.</p><p id=par-10_62>The sisters’ fame means that it’s difficult to keep your personal life out of the public eye. This becomes even more difficult if you are in a relationship with another celebrity. Gigi recently ended a six-year relationship with singer Zayn Malik following his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">altercation with her mother</a>. The singer was subsequently charged with four counts of harassment, which he did not contest.</p><p id=par-11_47>Bella acknowledged that these happenings brought her and <a href=#>Gigi</a> closer together. In contrast, Bella’s personal life has been more secretive. She’s currently in a relationship with Marc Kalman, a romance dating back to July 2020. Kalman is an art director specializing in merchandise design and album art.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqbuMoqpmrJGhuaa%2BjKysqZ2iorylsctmnqKfmWK1orDInWSoql2Xsq24wGafmpyZmXupwMylZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
