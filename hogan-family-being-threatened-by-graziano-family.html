Both Hulk and Linda have publicly blamed John for his condition, saying that he should have been wearing a seatbelt. Well, yeah he should, but it wouldn’t have been a big issue if their 17-year-old hadn’t been drunk and drag racing in the street. And didn’t crash into a palm tree.</p><p>Then last week Hulk went on Larry King and said the crash was God’s will – to make John a better person. Not surprisingly, these kind of statements have really riled up the Graziano family, and as a result, they’ve been threatening the Hogans. Oh boo freaking hoo.</p><p>Clearwater police are investigating threatening phone calls made by a member of John Graziano’s family to the family of Terry Bollea, also known as Hulk Hogan, according to Clearwater police spokesman Doug Matthews.</p><p>Matthews could not say which member of the Graziano family allegedly made the threats; nor could he say which member of the Bollea family received them.</p><p>Morris “Sandy” Weinberg, an attorney for Nick Bollea, 17, who is serving a jail sentence on a charge of reckless driving with serious driving bodily injury, confirmed that the police had listened to the threatening voicemails.</p><p>“Does the family take it seriously?” he asked. “Yes, they do.” No arrests have been made.</p><p>[From the <a href=#>St. Petersburg Times</a>]</p><p>Well of course the Hogan family takes it seriously. When even minor bad stuff happens to them, it’s the end of the world. But they’re fine with supplying their minor son with alcohol, then letting him drive a suped up car. And anything that results from it is everyone else’s fault. But if someone dare to leave a threatening voice mail on their answering machine, there will be absolute hell to pay.</p><p>Get over yourselves Hogans. There is a special spot in hell for you. Until then, if every one of your days is twice as miserable as the Graziano family’s, you should considering yourselves really, really lucky.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmampjaoZwtM6gmKeXlpa6qrjYmJmeoZ6crLW00Z6YrZ2emrGgrtiYnquZqp6ur7u%2Bn5imoZyufA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
