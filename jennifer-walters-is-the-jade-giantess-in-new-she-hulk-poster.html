While Mark Ruffalo’s beleaguered scientist spent years wrestling with “the other guy,” the promos for the incoming Disney Plus series have promised that Jen will embrace her superhero form much quicker. Forget what the song told you, she makes being green look easy.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=446 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>Case in point, this newly unveiled poster for the show, which spotlights the Jade Giantess smiling at the “camera.” The poster actually does a great job making reference to the two major elements of Attorney at Law, which is being pitched as a legal-flavored sitcom. Jen’s wearing a smart tweed jacket, a nod to her career as a lawyer, and her fourth-wall breaking pose teases the Deadpool-like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">meta-humor that’s to come</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/She-Hulk-Poster.jpg><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true>While Jen might immediately be in control of her Hulk form — just as in the comics, and like Smart Hulk, she’ll be in full possession of her mental faculties while green — she’ll nonetheless have to struggle with her own unique challenges. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Maslany has teased</a> the “interesting nuance” that comes from the show’s depiction of Jen’s experience as a female Hulk, which inspires a very different reaction from the media and the public than Bruce’s Hulk.</p><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>Speaking of Bruce, the familial bond between the two cousins will be at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the heart of the series</a>, with Banner somewhat acting as the Obi-Wan Kenobi to Jen’s Luke Skywalker as he teaches her how to deal with her alter ego, once she gains her powers after getting caught in a car crash. Also look out for Tim Roth’s Abomination, Benedict Wong’s Wong, and Jameela Jamil as main villain Titania.</p><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=114 data-injectable=false>She-Hulk: Attorney at Law premieres the first episode of its nine-part, half-hour run on Disney Plus this Aug. 18.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yrsc2noJ%2BdomLEorjTnqmsZZmoerW0xGahmpyVYrSqrc2tnKyrXZ67brrEsGSsoJVitba4ymanqKukmr9w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
