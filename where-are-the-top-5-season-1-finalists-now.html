But where are the fierce athletes now? Here is everything you need to know about season 1’s five finalist that outlasted the standouts like <a href=#>Choo Sung-hoon</a>.</p><p id=par-2_11><strong>[SPOILER ALERT: This article contains spoilers for Physical 100 episode 9.]</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><h2>5. Kim Min-cheol</h2><p id=par-3_35>The first challenge of the final quest focused on strength. <a href=#>Kim Min-cheol</a> struggled to reach his key in the tug-of-war game. But managed to get it to unlock his lock a second after Woo Jin-yong.</p><p id=par-4_26>“I’m so sad to go,” the rescuer said. “You four, don’t get hurt, and do your best.” He broke his bust and then left the arena.</p><p id=par-5_42>Kim is continuing to compete in ice climbing. He posted a video of one of his races on Feb. 18 on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>. The climber competed in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">UIAA Ice Climbing </a>World Cup this year, and his highest rank was sixth in speed men.</p><h2>4. Jo Jin-hyeong</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Physical-100-Jo-Jin-hyeong-Jang-Eun-sil-Seo-Ha-yan-Miho.jpg><p id=par-6_45>The second challenge in quest 5 had the four finalists split into two teams. <a href=#>Jo Jin-hyeong</a> partnerned with Woo since Jung Hae-min picked Park Jin-yong. All of the teams had to flip tiles for five minutes. The losing team then faced off with their teammate.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_23>Jo and Woo lost, and the strongman was losing energy. They faced off in the same game for three minutes, and Jo lost.</p><p id=par-8_43>“I wanted to flip more, but toward the end, my body just wouldn’t respond,” he explained. “So I dropped a board or two. Or grabbed one but couldn’t flip it. That’s how bad it was. I was losing it mentally toward the end.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_45>Jo has kept busy working out in the gym and hanging out with Physical 100 cast members, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his Instagram</a>. He also has a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a> channel showing his strength by breaking apart cars and more. But his last uploaded video was a year ago.</p><h2>3. Park Jin-yong</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_36>The third challenge was for the final three to run back and forth and ring a bell. The first one to drop out is eliminated. All three stayed strong, but their run time kept getting shorter.</p><p id=par-11_41>“As the intervals got shorter, I ran out of breath,” Park said. “I thought I was gonna die. My legs were tired, and it was the first time as an athlete that they almost gave out.” He stopped after 85 reps.</p><p id=par-12_22>The national team luge player has made reaction videos to Physical 100 on YouTube. He also vlogs about his day and training.</p><h2>2. Jung Hae-min</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Physical-100-Choo-Sung-hoon-quest-4.jpg><p id=par-13_25>The final challenge was for Jung and Woo to pull an infinite rope. Whoever finishes first wins. At first, Jung seemed to have the advantage.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_34>“I was so out of breath, and my legs hurt so much,” he said. “But in my head was the desperate thought that I wanted to win.”&nbsp; Woo took the lead and finished first.</p><p id=par-15_24>The cyclist recently traveled to Italy, Switzerland, and Spain. He also ended 2022 strong by winning another race and getting a <a href=#>50,000,000 won prize</a>.</p><h2 id=h-1-woo-jin-yong>1. Woo Jin-yong</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Physical-100-huddle-Jeong-Han-saem-Cho-Jung-myung-Cha-Hyun-seung-and-Woo-Jin-yong.jpg><p id=par-16_45>Woo struggled to pull the rope in the final challenge but found different ways to keep going. One of them was closing his eyes and going into a trance as he pulled. Woo sped up when he heard the other cast members cheering them on.</p><p id=par-17_35>“What I can say I have more than others is tenacity, I have grit,” he said. “Even if my arms won’t move. Let’s go. Even if I have no energy, let’s just grab and pull.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-18_32>The winner is staying fit by lifting weights in the gym. He recently posted a picture of him hanging out with other Physical 100 competitors at an indoor climbing gym <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on Instagram</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qcXSopqapF1mfXF51qGcq51dqbWmedOop2ZtXaiyor%2FOp2RqZZaeu6K4yKyrrGWepMRvtNOmo2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
