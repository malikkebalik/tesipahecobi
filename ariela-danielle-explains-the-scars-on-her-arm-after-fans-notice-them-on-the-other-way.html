Not only was Ariela pregnant, but she was also flying half-way around the world to visit a foreign country.</p><p id=par-3_39>With so many things on her mind, Ariela experienced an anxiety attack almost as soon as she got off the plane. Fortunately, the reality star’s mother had accompanied her on the trip and was there to offer emotional support.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_39>Following her anxiety attack, 90 Day Fiancé fans were quick to notice that Ariela was sporting a series of scars on her arm. Fans had not noticed them earlier in the season because Ariela was usually sporting long sleeves.</p><p id=par-5_19>Turns out, these marks are connected to Ariela’s struggles with mental health – something she confirmed after the episode.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ariela Danielle opens up about her scars</h2><p id=par-6_38>Fans immediately began to speculate about the scars following Ariela’s episode on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way. Many viewers suspected that the scars were self-inflicted while others took to the internet to ask Ariela about what happened.</p><p id=par-7_43>In response, the <a href=#>90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way</a> star revealed that the scars on her arm were indeed self-inflicted. She also explained how she experienced a “tumultuous adolescence” that forced her to question “the world” and her life “at a young age.”</p><p id=par-8_29>“It has come to my attention that people are interested to know about the scars on my arms,” she stated. “I want to say that yes they are self-inflicted.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" id=emb-3 readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CC-kcIBDQY-/</p></figure><p id=par-9_23>Ariela didn’t go into too much detail about her mental health issues, but it does explain what happened when she traveled to Ethiopia.</p><p id=par-10_48>The reality star went on to say that she participated in self-harm because she “could not find peace” in her life. She also stated that cutting was an “answer” to her problems at the time, though it is unclear if this is something she is still dealing with.</p><p id=par-11_43>Luckily, Ariela promised fans that she will open up more about her history and that she is “not ashamed” of what she has experienced. She then thanked 90 Day Fiancé fans for being so understanding and allowing her the opportunity to explain herself.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Inside Biniyam’s first American marriage</h2><p id=par-12_51>While it will be interesting to see what Ariela has to say about her past, her <a href=#>relationship with Biniyam</a> has already run into a few roadblocks. One of their biggest issues so far is the fact that Biniyam was once married to an American woman, with whom he shares a child.</p><p id=par-13_38>After 90 Day Fiancé fans learned about Biniyam’s past, they suspected that history might be repeating itself with Ariela. After all, she shares plenty of similarities with Biniyam’s first wife and is currently expecting a baby with him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-14_38>To make things even worse, a video of <a href=#>Biniyam’s wedding</a> has since surfaced online. The ceremony was held at a church in New London in the summer of 2017, around five months after the couple welcomed their baby.</p><p id=par-15_24>We still do not know why Biniyam’s first marriage fell apart, but fans are officially nervous that the same thing will happen to Ariela.</p><p id=par-16_21>Fans can watch the drama unfold when new episodes of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way air Monday nights on TLC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSGcXnDmrBmnpmWu6SxjJqpop2clnqlrc2inKWklWKyubzLmqCnq12ptaZ50pyYq6tdpLtutMSrZJqqnWKup8DEq2SfmZ6oeq%2B706KanmWknbKuec6nZK2glWK8tbTEq2SwmaljtbW5y2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
