Celebrity</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>The Attack on Titan manga has been completed, and fans were quite shocked while reading the penultimate chapter, which is chapter 138. Attack on Titan fans could not believe their eyes as Eren died at the hands of Mikasa. Fans questioned if Eren would come back to life, and the final chapter of the manga confirmed the protagonist’s fate.</p><p>Fast-forwarding to the manga’s more recent chapters, fans have received an update about Eren’s own lifespan in Chapter #130 of the manga, wherein he claims to have only four years left. This tidbit has sparked a renewed interest in exactly how the Curse of Ymir works, and whether Eren is possibly an exception to the rule.</p><p>After that, he split the back of the titan’s neck, and he escaped in his normal “human form” Spoiler Incoming: Eren did not actually die. I’m assuming you acted the same way that I did when I saw that scene.</p><p>This implies that even if Eren is currently dead, Zeke can use the Founder’s powers to bring him back to life, which seems like what he plans to do anyway.</p><h2>Did Eren die in Titans?</h2><p>As you continue watching the show, you would see that<strong> Eren</strong> did<strong> not</strong> die, but in fact, the way he survived the titan, was by turning into one himself. He somehow changed, and he began fighting other titans. After that, he split the back of the titan’s neck, and he escaped in his normal “human form”.</p><p>In my opinion,<strong> Eren didn’t turn into a bird.</strong> The bird that pulled Mikasa’s scarf was the same bird that was flying over Falco during the start of Ss4 and eavesdropping on Armin’s confession to Annie. But that doesn’t mean Eren wasn’t reincarnated. Let me explain why….</p><p><strong>Eren Jaeger is in all of us.</strong> He is in me, he is in you, he is in every person that has ever existed. Nobody, I repeat, nobody is born evil, this is the sole reason why Eren has always been<strong> in every one of us.</strong> Eren is suppressed by some, left alone by some, brought out by few, and killed by all.</p><p>Then there’s the revelations about Grisha Yeager, the fact that he had another life before Eren was even born, and not only that, had had another family, one he hadn’t told anyone about. And not only that, but it had then turned out that Grishas first wife had been turned into a titan while he watched.</p><h2>How many chapters does Eren appear in?</h2><p>Eren makes his re-appearance in Chapter 98 of the manga. Currently, the anime has adapted the first 4 chapters (Chapter 91 to 94), i.e, two chapters per episode. It is likely Episode 3 will adapt Chapter 95 and 96 which in the manga is Reiner’s backstory. As seen from the preview, that seems to be the case.</p><p><strong>Attack on Titan’s return to the screen was met with</strong> mixed reactions from fans. Fans seemed to be extra vigilant regarding the animation quality, sound and adaptation after the news of studio change.</p><p>This cameo is merely meant to set a build up to his actions and serve as a surprise for anime-onlys later. But<strong> it indeed confirms that Eren is in Marley.</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGibqJ2jYrKzsc1mmqillWKvoq%2FKZquoZZyes6Z5kGptbWhnZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
