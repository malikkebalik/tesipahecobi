He was educated at the Solomon Schechter Day School of Greater Boston and Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School. Gordon went on to attend the University of Vermont, from which he earned his BA degree.</p><h2 id=phish><strong>Phish</strong></h2><p>While a student at the University of Vermont, Gordon met fellow students <a href=#>Trey Anastasio</a>, Jeff Holdsworth, and <a href=#>Jon Fishman</a>. Together, they formed the rock band Phish in 1983. Gordon played bass, Anastasio and Holdsworth guitar, and Fishman the drums; all of them performed vocals as well. In 1985, the band added keyboardist <a href=#>Page McConnell</a>, and the year after that, Holdsworth made his exit. Phish went on to self-release its debut album, "Junta," in 1989. The following year, the band released "Lawn Boy" via Absolute A Go Go Records and Rough Trade Records. In 1992, Phish made its major-label debut with "A Picture of Nectar," released by Elektra Records. The album established the band's eclectic style, incorporating such genres as jazz, rock, psychedelia, and country. Subsequent Phish albums were "Rift," "Hoist," and "Billy Breathes," which brought the band to more mainstream attention. Closing out the decade, the group released "The Story of the Ghost" and "The Siket Disc." Notable studio albums by Phish in the 21st century include "Farmhouse," "Undermind," "Joy," and "Get More Down." Since 2005, the band has issued albums through its own independent record label, JEMP Records.</p><h2 id=albums-with-leo-kottke><strong>Albums with Leo Kottke</strong></h2><p>Outside of Phish, Gordon has frequently collaborated with acoustic guitarist Leo Kottke.
