Car Accident – Porsche 911 Crash</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>A Porsche 911 GT2 RS with severe damage painted in green was found at Copart and was reported earlier this week.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to a new piece of information, the crashed Porsche 911 GT2 RS found earlier could be owned by professional golfer Patrick Reed.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Copart has stated that the damaged car under discussion, a 2019 Porsche 911 GT2 RS, is registered in Houston, Texas.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The damaged Porsche has a wholly destroyed driver’s side front bumper, revealing the wheel, severe damage on both sides and the absence of the rear wing.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Unfortunately, the incident occurred when the supercar had only been driven for 361 miles, rendering it destroyed even before the end of its break-in period.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The possibility that Patrick Reed is the owner of the crashed Porsche 911 GT2 RS was first brought to light by a post on Reddit. This clue has led to further speculation regarding his ownership of the car.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Many Reddit users started discussions about the crash and firmly believed it was Reed’s car, primarily because of his Instagram Post featuring Porsche.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Some claimed that he had had a DUI Arrest in the past.
