<span class=val><time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2024-10-01>October 01, 2024</time></span></div><section class=summary>It's undeniable that Reese Witherspoon has been incredibly successful at leveraging her fame into an entire brand that's completely outside her film and television career. In 2021, she sold her production company Hello Sunshine for $900 million, and she recently made another big payday by selling a 70 percent stake in her fashion and lifestyle brand Draper James to Consortium Brand Partners. That led some outlets to report that she had officially reached billionaire status, but according to Witherspoon herself, that isn't true. <a href=../../reese-witherspoon-denies-reports-that-she-s-a-billionaire.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../what-has-uche-said-in-the-wake-of-love-is-blind-season-5.html>What has Uche said in the wake of Love is Blind season 5?</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
<span class=val><time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2024-10-01>October 01, 2024</time></span></div><section class=summary>Season 5 of Love is Blind had a few standout villains.
Recommended Videos My personal vendetta was largely against Stacy and her money-obsessed, bullying behavior, but Uche Okoroha was a clear standout for many of the season’s viewers. The Houston-based lawyer and entrepreneur put out good energy at first, as he chatted his way through a series of dates, but when things got serious, fans got salty. A prickly conversation between Uche and his main match of the season, Aaliyah Cosby, lost Uche any fans he may have had, after he belittled the ICU nurse over a two-years past cheating incident. <a href=../../what-has-uche-said-in-the-wake-of-love-is-blind-season-5.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../you-can-now-resell-shein-goods-with-shein-exchange-resale-program.html>You Can Now Resell Shein Goods with 'Shein Exchange' Resale Program</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
<span class=val><time itemprop=datePublished datetime=2024-10-01>October 01, 2024</time></span></div><section class=summary>On Monday, fast-fashion retailer Shein launched its resale program “Shein Exchange.”&nbsp;
The online-only (and app-supported) peer-to-peer resale program facilitates the sale and purchase of secondhand Shein products. The pilot program (powered by service provider Treet) is available in the U.S. to start as part of the company’s broader circularity commitments.&nbsp;
“The goal of Shein Exchange is to make resale just as easy and convenient as buying something brand new, while also igniting a cultural movement of circularity within our own Shein community,” Adam Whinston, global head of ESG at Shein, said in a statement. <a href=../../you-can-now-resell-shein-goods-with-shein-exchange-resale-program.html>Read More...</a></section></article></div><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=../../page/3/index.html>&lt; Prev</a>
