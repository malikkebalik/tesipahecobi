Ciccone has collaborated with his sister on a few occasions. In his 2008 book <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Life with My Sister Madonna</a>, Ciccone discussed appearing in one of the singer’s music videos.</p><p id=par-4_61>“At the beginning of February, Madonna asks [me] to dance in her ‘Lucky Star’ video, to be shot in L.A., and … I fly there,” he wrote. “This is my first trip out there since I was a teenager. I have never seen so many palm trees, so much sun, and so many tanned and perfectly stretched faces in my life.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Christoper Ciccone thought about appearing in the video for 1 of Madonna’s songs</h2><p id=par-5_58>Ciccone revealed what it was like to appear in the “Lucky Star” video. “We shoot the video at the old <a href=#>Charlie Chaplin</a> studio, which is pretty much the same as when it was originally built in the ’30s,” he recalled. “I get paid just $200 for dancing in the ‘Lucky Star’ video and don’t get any royalties either.”</p><p id=par-6_69>Even if Ciccone didn’t earn a tremendous amount of money from his appearance in “Lucky Star,” he had fond memories of the experience. “However, at the time, I am happy just to be a part of it,” he noted. “The camaraderie between Madonna … and me is enough for me. After we shoot the video, we all go to Studio One, above Rose Tattoo, and dance the night away.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-way-the-world-reacted-to-lucky-star>The way the world reacted to ‘Lucky Star’</h2><p id=par-7_62>“Lucky Star” became a hit.

Meanwhile, Madonna peaked at No. 6, staying on the chart for 125 weeks.</p><p id=par-9_44>“Lucky Star” and its music video had an impact on pop culture.
