And while you might assume that the vast majority of Bill Gates' net worth is connected to the company he co-founded, Microsoft, that is actually NOT the case. Today he "only" owns 103 million shares of Microsoft, which assuming a $370 price per share, equates to "just" $38 billion of his net worth today. The remaining roughly $100 billion net worth comes from an extremely diverse portfolio of investments and assets that are primarily controlled by his investment vehicle, Cascade Investments. We'll detail more about Cascade throughout this article, but through Cascade Bill owns the majority of Four Seasons Hotel and Resorts and is the <a href=#>largest private owner of farmland in the United States</a>.</p><p><a href=#>When Microsoft went public in 1986</a>, Bill owned 45% of the company. Steve Ballmer owned 8%, and Paul Allen owned 25%. Through stock sales, by 2000 Bill's Microsoft stake had been reduced to 14%. Today he owns a little less than 1.4% of Microsoft, around 103 million shares. That does not make him the company's largest individual shareholder. That honor belongs to Bill's successor, Steve Ballmer, who owns around 4% of the company today. Thanks to Microsoft's $3 annual dividend, every year Bill receives $309 million in dividends. Ballmer receives close to $1 billion every year.</p><p>Over the decades Bill has received nearly $60 billion in the form of stock sales and dividends from Microsoft and other investments. The proceeds of his sales and dividends have funded Cascade Investment LLC, the vehicle Gates uses to invest in hundreds of other companies including 270,000 acres of American farmland, significant stakes in public stocks including Apple, Canadian National Railway, Republic Services, Ecolab, Waste Management and Berkshire Hathaway. Cascade also controls the Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts.</p><p>For much of the period between 1997 and 2008, Bill was the <a href=#>richest person in the world</a> uninterrupted. He traded spots with Carlos Slim for a few years before regaining the crown uninterrupted again until July 2017 when he was overtaken by Amazon founder <a href=# title="Jeff Bezos Net Worth">Jeff Bezos</a>. In the last decade Bill has consistently been one of the five richest people on the planet.</p><p>Microsoft began as a conversation between two young men who had been friends since elementary school, Bill Gates and <a href=#>Paul Allen</a>. After basically lying their way into an interview with MITS, the corporation behind the Altair 8800 computer, the two men convinced the company to build and sell their interpreter, and in 1975, MITS launched the Altair BASIC.&nbsp; This initial success allowed the pair to develop their own company, which they named Microsoft.&nbsp; By 1977, they had their first international office in Japan, and relocated their domestic office to the state of Washington.&nbsp; In 1980, they won a bid to develop an operating system for IBM, and MS-DOS was born.&nbsp; From the mid-80s to the mid-90s, the company established itself as a technological powerhouse, and not long after it went public in 1986, 12,000 of its employees became millionaires, and another four became billionaires.&nbsp; They were also hit with a number of anti-trust lawsuits around this time, due to business practices that appeared to monopolize the computer market.&nbsp; The mid-90s brought an expansion in products, including networking and World Wide Web applications, such as the popular browser, Internet Explorer.&nbsp; In 2000, Bill Gates retired from the position of CEO, and <a href=#>Steve Ballmer</a>, a long time employee took over. Today <a href=#>Satya Nadella</a> is the CEO.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-295419 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ReV01-03-medium.jpg alt width=900 height=552 sizes="(max-width: 2154px) 100vw, 2154px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-295419 class=wp-caption-text>Bill Gates Net Worth Milestones</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>William Henry Gates III&nbsp;was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington.&nbsp;Gates was bullied as a child. He preferred to stay in his room where he would shout "I'm thinking" when his mother asked what he was doing. When he was 13, he enrolled in the private Lakeside prep school&nbsp;and he wrote his first software program. He was in eighth grade during his first year at Lakeside and the school's Mother's Club used proceeds from a fundraiser to buy a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and time on a GE computer for the school's students. Gates became interested in programming the GE computer in BASIC. He wrote his first program â€” a tic-tac-toe game, on this computer. Players played the game against the computer. Eventually, Gates and his friends Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and Kent Evans were banned from using the school's computer after they were caught exploiting bugs in the operating system to get free time on the machine.&nbsp;The four students formed the Lakeside Programmers Club to make money.</p><p>When their ban was over, the boys offered to look for bugs in the software in exchange for extra time on the computer. Gates began studying code to the programs that ran on the computer including Fortran, Lisp, and machine language. In 1971, a Lakeside teacher asked Gates and Evans to automate the school's class-scheduling system. The friends wrote software with one twistâ€“Gates changed the code so that he was in classes with a higher number of interesting girls. Gates and Evans wanted to have the new system up and running by senior year. Then, at the end of their junior year, Evans was killed in a mountain climbing accident. Gates turned to Allen to help him finish the project for Lakeside.</p><p>During their senior year, Gates and Allen formed a company called Traf-O-Data and made traffic counters on the Intel 8008 processer. He graduated from Lakeside School in 1973 and enrolled at Harvard in the fall of 1973. At Harvard, Gates took math and graduate-level computer science classes. He met Steve Ballmer at Harvard. Gates dropped out of college at the end of his sophomore year.</p>Key Facts<ul><li>Net worth topped $350m when Microsoft went public in 1986</li><li>First became a billionaire in 1987.

The creators of the new microcomputer, Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), formed a partnership with Gates and Allen using their Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The trade name Microsoft was registered on November 26, 1976. During the first five years of the Microsoft company, Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, often rewriting code as needed. On November 20, 1985, Microsoft launched its first retail version of Microsoft Windows.</p><p>Microsoft went public in 1986. The opening stock price was $21. After the trading day, the stock closed at $27.75 and Bill's 45% was worth $350 million. Less than a year later, after the stock surged, he was a billionaire. He was 31 years old.</p><p>Gates announced on June 15, 2006, that he would transition out of his day-to-day role at Microsoft over the next two years in order to dedicate more time to philanthropy.</p><p>On March 13, 2020, Gates announced he would step down as Microsoft's Chairman.</p><h2 id=cascade-investments><strong>Cascade Investments</strong></h2><p>Over the years Bill has earned more than $50 billion from dividends and stock sales which he then used to fund Cascade Investment, his private investment vehicle. Today Cascade reportedly has more than $200 billion in assets under management which it has invested in a diverse and substantial investment portfolio. Some of its largest and most prominent investments include:</p><ul><li><strong>Farmland</strong>: Cascade Investment is the largest farmland owner in the United States, owning 269,000 acres through a network of shell companies.
