But to this day, fans and critics speak with awe about his body of work. Hoffman appeared in many high-profile&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">films</a>&nbsp;throughout his career, including&nbsp;Doubt, Charlie Wilson’s War, The Big Lebowski, and&nbsp;The Talented Mr. Ripley. One of his most iconic films is the 2005 release&nbsp;Capote, which featured Hoffman as the famed American novelist&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Truman Capote</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_48>The actor prepared for the role for months, working hard on not only mastering the writer’s mannerisms but his accent as well. In a 2005 interview, Hoffman opened up about how he captured Capote’s unique speaking voice, revealing that he was committed to ensuring the performance was “honest.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-capote-received-overwhelming-critical-acclaim>‘Capote’ received overwhelming critical acclaim</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_47>Released in 2005,&nbsp;Capote&nbsp;focuses primarily on the events surrounding the author’s 1965 book&nbsp;In Cold Blood. Based on the biography of Capote by Gerald Clarke,&nbsp;Capote&nbsp;features a star-studded cast, including Hoffman, Catherine Keener, Amy Ryan, and Chris Cooper. Intense, dramatic, and riveting,&nbsp;Capote&nbsp;made a splash and received five Academy Award nominations.</p><p id=par-4_123>Much of the praise for the film centered on Hoffman’s performance, which critics say&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">perfectly captured Capote’s personality</a>&nbsp;and internal struggles. The actor won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his work in&nbsp;Capote, cementing his status as one of Hollywood’s greatest character actors. Interestingly enough,&nbsp;Capote&nbsp;director Bennett Miller later recalled that he took a big chance casting Hoffman as the famed writer. “When I think back on it, I think it was totally insane,” he recalled. As reported by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiewire</a>, Miller related how “Capote was 5′ 2”, Phil was 5’10″1/2, he weighed about 240 lbs, and had a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">deep voice</a>, thick wrists like a wrestler or a football player — like a jock. He did have the right color hair, though. But he was an amazing actor.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-did-philip-seymour-hoffman-say-about-capturing-truman-capote-s-accent-in-capote>What did Philip Seymour Hoffman say about capturing Truman Capote’s accent in ‘Capote’?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/philip-seymour-hoffman-capote.jpg><p id=par-5_97>Even though Hoffman wasn’t a physical match for the late author, the actor was more concerned with perfectly bringing Capote’s personality to life through emotional representation rather than mimicry. In a 2005 interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NPR</a>, Hoffman opened up about how he nailed Capote’s speaking voice. “I knew that it had to be true, which sounds kind of corny, but I knew it had to be honest, and then I knew it had to express the vitality and the nuances of Truman Capote,” Hoffman said. But he chose not to do the “mimic thing,” saying it “isn’t as interesting.”</p><p id=par-6_65>In October 2005, Hoffman told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone Magazine</a>&nbsp;that he deeply feared messing up with&nbsp;Capote. “I feel like I’m horrible until I actually get it right,” he explained. In the end, Hoffman credited “diligence” and hard work for helping him to master Capote’s persona. To this day, viewers who watch&nbsp;Capote&nbsp;are struck by how authentic the actor’s performance feels. And most consider the film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of Hoffman’s best</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-toby-jones-has-also-played-truman-capote>Toby Jones has also played Truman Capote</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_69>Hoffman isn’t the only actor who has portrayed&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Capote</a>&nbsp;onscreen. In 2006, character actor Toby Jones played him in&nbsp;Infamous, a drama co-starring Daniel Craig and Sandra Bullock. In October 2006, Jones opened up to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>&nbsp;about what it was like to have his performance compared to Hoffman’s. “I’m very flattered to be even compared with Philip Seymour Hoffman,” Jones said. “It’s not something that was happening to me a few months ago.”</p><p id=par-8_39>Jones also noted that he’s “proud” of the film. And he worked hard with a vocal coach to capture Capote’s unique “squeaky” voice. “I was trying to actually use the voice rather than be trapped by it,” Jones admitted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qbXLoqdmq5WuurDB0WafqJ6Woq6vecOim6esXam%2FunnMoqSim12pv7a5wKdknJmgpMGmeceopZ6rpGO1tbnLaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
