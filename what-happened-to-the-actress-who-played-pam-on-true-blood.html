Joining her costar is Kristin Bauer Van Starten, the flawless actress behind the often sarcastic, sometimes cruel, Pam Swynford De Beaufort.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What has Kirsten Bauer been in?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Season 2 of the official <a href=#>@hbomax</a> <a href=#>#TrueBlood</a> Podcast is back with the <a href=#>@smoyer</a> !!!

The actress‚Äôs roles include parts in Star Trek: Enterprise, LA Law, Everybody Loves Raymond, Dark Angel, Two and a Half Men, CSI, Desperate Housewives, and in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Seinfeld</a> ‚Äî Bauer Jerry‚Äôs ‚Äúman-hands‚Äù girlfriend in the classic episode ‚ÄúThe Bizzaro Jerry.‚Äù</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>The actress has found herself plenty of success in films as well. She starred alongside Ben Affleck in Glory Daze before landing her role as Kelly Possenger in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Romy and Michelle‚Äôs High School Reunion</a>. Perhaps her most well-known movie role was as a dancer in Dancing at the Blue Laguna, which featured her in a lengthy nude dance scene.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=true>Beyond screen roles, Bauer has lent her voice to several animated DC comics productions, like Justice League, and Suicide Squad. Much more recently, the actress portrayed an evil fairy called Maleficent (not to be confused with the maleficent) in the ABC series Once Upon a Time.</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=170 data-injectable=false>Of course, the reason you‚Äôre here today is because of her best-known role that of the often sardonic, and occasionally cruel, Pamela Swynford De Beaufort in True Blood.</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-to-pam-s-actress-after-true-blood data-injectable=false>What happened to Pam‚Äôs actress after True Blood?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Join us & our fellow animal lovers & actors, <a href=#>@iamkristinbauer</a> & <a href=#>@jamesocromwell</a> for <a href=#>#GivingTuesday</a>! üêÖüêòüêíü¶ß</p><p>Together, we can protect & preserve Asian wildlife worldwide. üåèüêæ<a href=#>#AsiaWild</a> <a href=#>#SupportAsianAnimals</a> <a href=#>#ConservationNonprofit</a> <a href=#>#EndangeredSpecies</a> <a href=#>#SupportWildlife</a> <a href=#>#DonateNow</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/yb4ZcbcLbh</a></p>‚Äî Asia Wild (@asiawildorg) <a href=#>November 28, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>Since True Blood wrapped in 2014, Bauer has been far less busy, it seems. Since 2021, the True Blood star has been relatively absent from the acting world. Her last project, Paradise Cove, was largely panned by critics. Despite the consensus that Bauer plays a solid psychopath, and her solid experience playing a somewhat unhinged killer from her time as Pam, the film sits at an abysmal 36% on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rotten Tomatoes</a>.</p><p data-characters=466 data-current-count=466 data-injectable=true>Rather than dedicate her life to acting, it seems Bauer is honing other skills. She has mentioned in interviews that she loves to oil paint. Wikipedia claims that Bauer is a working artist who specializes in portraits, but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any actual art available for viewing on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her website</a>. There is, however, a way to tap Bauer for a personalized recording. Fans can request personalized <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cameo videos</a> from the creative ‚Äì at the right price, of course.</p><p data-characters=622 data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true>In addition to her side gigs, Bauer runs <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Truest Blood</a>, a True Blood podcast. Fellow True Blood alum <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deborah Ann Woll</a> (Daredevil) cohosts the podcast. But it seems the thing the actress concerns herself with the most these days is her activism. Bauer is an avid animal rights activist, and regularly posts about animal mistreatment. From Rodeos and mega-farms to animal adoption and declining biodiversity, Bauer‚Äôs Twitter feed is packed with eco-friendly calls to action. Bauer isn‚Äôt alone in her fight for animal rights, her husband of 13 years, South African musician <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Abri van Straten</a>, is just as diligent as she is.</p><p data-characters=459 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=false>The pair met while van Straten was on tour in the U.S. in 2009, and he relocated to California to be with his actress wife soon after. The couple have multiple rescued pets, but no children just yet. She told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sheknows</a> in 2014 that they had discussed kids, but Bauer says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm such a rescuer, so that is more the area that I would go. It kills me that there are kids in foster homes and unwanted children, so [adoption] to me would be more up my alley.‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7HDZquoZaSdsm6twq2pnqujYsSpu4ypo5qxlZl6sa3MZqanZaSnwqZ5waWmqJxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
