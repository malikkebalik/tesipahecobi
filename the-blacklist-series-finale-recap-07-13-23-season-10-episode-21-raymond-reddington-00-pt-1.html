Even Dembe feared him. Dembe had wiped his slate clean and he joined the FBI. He then put all of that risk by warning Reddington that the Congressman was coming for him. Reddington later thanked Dembe for doing that only he too pointed out what a risk that had been.</p><p>Reddington would never want to put his loved ones in harm’s way. Redington told Dembe goodbye and then he put his plan into action. He knew that the FBI would hunt him. And so he did everything possible to confuse them or at the very most mislead them.</p><p>Reddington took a car from Cooper’s house that he knew would be traced. He then flooded the streets with similar vehicles. The FBI were spread thin all over the city and in spite of that they still wouldn’t listen to Cooper’s team. They chose to ignore his advice. It led to tensions at their office. Which wasn’t helped by the Congressman telling Ressler he’s sorry about the loss of his friend. The one that died. Ressler punched him. He was lucky when the Congressman didn’t press charges. Cooper had to speak to his people after that incident.</p><p>It doesn’t matter what they think about the situation. Their sole task was to hunt down criminals and that’s what Reddington is. Reddington has always been a criminal. It was time to bring him to justice even as they were all rooting for Reddington to escape capture. They thought he would use his billions to go hide out somewhere else in the world. They knew him the longest. They thought they could counter his every move. They offered to assist the FBI team looking for Reddington and they found their advice constantly ignored.</p><p>Not that it really matters because Reddington didn’t leave town. He made it look like he left while he was hiding out with his friend, Paula. Paula knew she was harboring a criminal only she didn’t care about the implications. She hid Red long enough for him to catch some sleep and to eventually escape. By time Dembe was able to convince the FBI to let his own team look for Reddington, Red had already moved on elsewhere. They found out from Paula that he had been talking to Andrea. And out of kindness to her, they didn’t tell the rest of the FBI that Paula aided a criminal.</p><p>Andrea was the real estate agent that once helped Red in the past. Dembe remembered this and so he and Malik tracked down Andrea. They found out that she dropped everything for a VIP client at the last minute. They knew she borrowed the key to a lockbox and so they went to the address hoping to find Red there. Only he wasn’t there at the house. The house was also on fire. Reddington managed to find a fire truck and so he started a fire to use the fire truck to get pass the roadblocks that the FBI set up. And Dembe didn’t realize until after the fire truck cleared a checkpoint.</p><p>Dembe then told the rest of the team about what happened. He was doing everything possible to help aide in Red’s capture. He just was too late to fall in line. Agent Nixon had found out someone within the department had warned Reddington about the raid. He went to the Congressman. They later detained Agent Ishwood. They claimed he was the mole and Nixon then chose to ride with Dembe to track down Reddington. They knew that Red was last seen near the harbor. Red owns controlling interests in several fishing boats.</p><p>Red likes being a major seafood supplier. Dembe remembered this. He and Nixon went down to the marina where Dembe figured out which boat his friend took. But the Congressman had realized Ishwood wasn’t their mole. They traced the phone call to Dembe. The Congressman called Nixon. Nixon arrested Dembe and they pretty much ignored his advice about Reddington. Dembe knew him best however they felt any information he could provide was tainted. They detained Dembe while they went looking for Reddington elsewhere.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnpJ2ybq7LmpqkpJmowW6%2FxKugnqtdm7avrcueZKudk5a9bnyWZmhsZWJoerSxwKymp2VhZXqmvMispp2dXWd%2Bbr7AsqSoppRiv6aww6KloKyfo3pxfIypq2ZpXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
