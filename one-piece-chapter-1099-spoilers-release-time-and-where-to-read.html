Not only did we learn about Ginny’s passing upon contracting a mysterious disease, but we also learned that Kuma vowed to protect and treat Bonney as his own, only to discover that<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> she has the same fatal disease as her mother</a>.</p><p data-characters=285 data-current-count=285 data-injectable=false>Despite this information dump in the last few chapters, there are still quite a few questions remaining, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bonney’s possession of her devil fruit</a>, and even her current health status. Bearing this in mind, let’s see what mysteries the new chapter will be unveiling.</p><h2 id=h-when-is-chapter-1099-coming-out data-injectable=false>When is chapter 1099 coming out?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/vegapunk-5-atlas-one-piece-manga.jpg><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>It feels like a lifetime since we’ve had a new chapter but it’s official: One Piece is coming back. Or at least, it has already reached the virtual shelves in Japan. Sadly, it will take a few more days to come to our reach, since the chapter <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">will be released in the Shõnen Jump Magazine on November 27</a>. However, anyone who has spent enough time online has probably stumbled upon the spoilers that have already been translated.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>As always, we’ll give you some time to click away from the article before you dive into the rest, but remember: this chapter is going to be juicy. Now that that’s out of the way, here’s a brief summary of the spoilers that were already translated by Twitter/X user OP_SPOILERS2023:</p><ul data-current-count=1387.5 data-injectable=true><li>King Bekori stands firm, refusing to abandon his liege to Kuma, and brings back marine forces to secure victory.</li><li>Despite Bekori’s efforts, Kuma repeatedly defeats the marine forces to ensure the safety of Sorbet Kingdom.</li><li>The story of how Bonney eats the Age-Age fruit is revealed.</li><li>The backstory behind Kuma’s title, “Tyrant” is also revealed.</li><li>Dragon shares Vegapunk’s location with Kuma, who then seeks Egghead to find a cure for Bonney’s disease.</li><li>Kuma agrees to become a prototype for the Pacifista project in exchange for saving Bonney’s life.</li><li>Jaygarcian Saturn makes a reappearance in the story.</li></ul><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>Besides this absolute rollercoaster of a chapter and all its spoilers, you can still rest assured knowing that Oda isn’t taking a break next week. This means that the eagerly awaited chapter 1100 is just around the corner, and hopefully, we’ll see our Straw Hats coming back and kicking some well-deserved (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and hopefully elder-ly</a>) backs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e86nnGaomZqwpnnCoZiprJWnenJ8mHJkrKifnrmmvtJmqZ6klZbApnnToqSeZZGjsW7Dx56pnmWkpHqzscCdZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
