But not with this story. In the <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a></strong> we see the uploader who goes by the name Charliebcx dancing on some pretty old looking steps. The caption reads “Leaving a h00kup but this guys staircase is kinda giving medieval” and the whole thing is accompanied by a middle ages rendition (I think the kids call it Bardcore) of “Hips Don’t Lie” by Shakira. To be fair, he’s not wrong when he says it’s giving medieval; those stairs look like they’ve been there since before America was “discovered.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@charliebcx href=#>@charliebcx</a><p><a title=stitch href=#>#stitch</a> with @Charliebcx homewrecker ❤️ <a title=gay href=#>#gay</a> <a title=marriage href=#>#marriage</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Charliebcx" href=#>♬ original sound – Charliebcx</a></figure><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>Of course, whilst making funneth of another’s medieval abode, thou accidentally exposed thine own sins to the very man thou mocked in jest.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true>That’s right, if you thought the caption was some made up story to garner more likes, then you’d be sorely mistaken. As it turns out, the TikTok found its way to the man whose house it was, and he obviously realized that his husband was seeing another man. The TikToker shares the texts he received from his lover asking if he’d recorded a TikTok on their staircase before telling him the secret’s out, “my husband saw this and asked if you and me met!!!”</p><p data-characters=409 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>It’s hard to imagine the mental damage inflicted from finding out that your partner cheated through a TikTok of the guy he cheated on you with dancing to bardcore Shakira on your staircase, but that somehow makes the whole thing even worse. In all likelihood we might have just witnessed the breakdown of a marriage on TikTok, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IFStudies</a> states that 40% of spouses who were married but cheated were divorced.</p><p data-characters=299 data-current-count=299 data-injectable=false>Whilst it’s kind of a messed up situation, many saw the funny side, let’s face it, the situation is kind of ridiculous. This would make for a great comedy film, what makes it even funnier is the part of the man’s contact name that hasn’t been censored tells us way more than we need to know.</p><p>“the contact name for me screaminggggg”</p><p>“Help the contact name”</p><p data-characters=129 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>Viewers are waiting with baited breath to see where the plot goes next, with many being caught completely off guard by the twist.</p><p>“I just favorited the other one like 10 minutes ago, this is quite the twist”</p><p>“AND THE PLOT THICKENS”</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=309 data-injectable=false>Of course, we’re all waiting to see where this goes, so hopefully we get an update soon. Given the look of that staircase, my money’s on the other man turning out to be a Viking or something.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8tbTEZpmin5eawLV5z6WmrWWkrLa0wIyhpqadp6eypLfEq2Sam5Oesaa605qjpbFdmsWxu9Keqmagmah6sMPNZpifnpGev261zWaroZ1dmcKursSsq2avka56sbvSrKCbpJVk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
