And two, Emilia announced the engagement with the hashtag #InItForLife. Which, as I said at the time, is not that difficult when you’re 31 and you’re marrying a 60-something dude. “In it for life” could be “in it for a decade or so.” No shade, though. I kind of want to marry Jeff Goldblum too. Anyway, Emilia and Jeff did the deed – they got married over the weekend. At the Chateau Marmont!</p><p>The knot is tied! Jeff Goldblum said “I do” for a third time on Saturday, Nov. 8, when he married longtime love Emilie Livingston after more than three years of dating, his rep confirms to Us Weekly.</p><p>The Jurassic Park star, 62, and Livingston, 31, exchanged vows in front of friends and family at L.A.’s Chateau Marmont, a source tells Us. “It was a night filled with love, music, and lots of laughs,” the insider says of the wedding, adding that Goldblum played piano and sang for his wife during the reception.</p><p>Livingston Instagrammed a photo of some champagne from the big day, writing, “Excited to see our pictures from our photographer but right now feeling so loved after a magical and enchanting evening on Saturday!!!”</p><p>Together since the fall of 2011, Goldblum and his bride got engaged in July of this year, shortly before they jetted off to Hawaii on vacation. Livingston — an actress, aerialist, and contortionist, according to her Twitter bio — posted about the proposal on Instagram, noting that she was “taken over by tears of joy n ecstasy” when he popped the question.</p><p>The Independence Day actor, for his part, gushed about his leading lady in an interview with Broadway.com last December, describing her as “spectacular and beautiful.”</p><p>“I’m happy as a clam with her. I feel lucky, lucky, lucky,” he raved, bragging that she was the “Pan American champion for rhythmic gymnastics” and a member of the Canadian Olympic team for rhythmic gymnastics in the 2000 Sydney games.</p><p>Goldblum was previously married to his Silverado costar Patricia Gaul from 1980 to 1986, and to his Earth Girls Are Easy costar Geena Davis from 1987 to 1990.</p><p><a href=#>[From Us Weekly]</a></p><p>I had to double-check just to make sure I was thinking of the right thing when I read “rhythmic gymnastics.” You know what that is, right? That’s the ribbon twirling!!! I was a child gymnast and I loved ribbon work, but “real” gymnasts don’t have much time for it. Still, it IS a sport and it does take a lot of flexibility. Cough. So, Little Miss #InItForLife might be looking to make Goldblum keel over from overexertion. Get money, Emilie! And congrats to both of them. I’m still side-eyeing the age difference, but whatever. It’s not like they got together when she was just a teenager. She’s old enough to know what she’s doing.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/wenn21318234.jpg alt=wenn21318234 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Instagram, WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbHFmboV4e8menZ%2BXl6S5pa7LrqSYbmKUuqK%2B0aKcnZeVorattcSYo6KumaO0tMDOp5ZsaY%2BWv6ar06GcspeZo7a1ss6ro6KelWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
