In 1984, Billingsley began voicing the character Nanny on the animated series "Muppet Babies," a role she continued through the show's end in 1991.</p><p>In the 90s, Billingsley made appearances on a number of sitcoms, including "Parker Lewis Can't Lose," "Empty Nest," "The Mommies," "Murphy Brown," and "Roseanne."
