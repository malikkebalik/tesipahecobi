"To lose that or dilute that is a betrayal of the character."</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>On top of that issue, the creators said there was also a lot of back and forth during the show's development over whether their titular character should attend a regular school or a magical academy.</p><p>"Because of the Harry Potter of it all [the question was] should she be at a regular school and then be a fish out of water?" Millar said. "But it felt kind of one-note and she'd always have to return home at night to the family that [we] wanted to get away from."</p><p>Co-directed and executive produced by Burton, "Wednesday" also stars Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia Addams, Luis Guzm√°n as Gomez Addams, Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester, and Isaac Ordonez as Pugsley Addams.</p><p>Christina Ricci, who&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-product-module=body_link>played Wednesday in the 1990s movies</a>, also appears as Ms. Thornhill, a teacher at Nevermore.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufony4scOnnKycka56pL7EmquoqqNiwKLFjKOcp6aRYryzwMSgmGackae4pr6MpaCnnaNirq25zqyrZpulqXpzfJFrZGpp</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
