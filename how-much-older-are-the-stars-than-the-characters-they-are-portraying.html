How much older are the actors than the characters they portray?</p><p>Published on February 13, 2022</p><span></span><span>2 min read</span><p id=par-1_67>The popular HBO series <a href=#>Euphoria</a> is a very dark show. The series deals with <a href=#>issues including drugs</a>, sex, and violence in the lives of high school students. Although the characters on the show are teens, they are portrayed by adult actors who are capable of handling the intense and sensitive subject matter. Here’s just how much older the Euphoria cast is than the characters they portray.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Euphoria-cast.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-many-of-euphoria-s-main-characters-are-17-years-old>Many of ‘Euphoria’s main characters are 17 years old</h2><p id=par-2_55>While it’s hard to get an exact age for some of the Euphoria characters, <a href=#>Rue and Jules</a> are definitely 17, as their ages are mentioned multiple times in the show. In reality, Rue actor Zendaya is 25 years old, while the actor who plays Jules, Hunter Schafer, is 22, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mary Sue</a>.</p><p id=par-3_71>Early in the series, Rue mentions that she and Lexi grew up together, so Lexi is likely also 17. She is played by Maude Apatow, who is 24 years old. This would make Rue, Jules, and Lexi juniors in high school. Twenty-six-year-old <a href=#>Dominic Fike</a> joined the cast of Euphoria Season 2. His character Elliot befriends Rue and Jules, so he is presumably a 17-year-old junior in high school as well.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Maddy and Kat might be younger high school seniors</h2><p id=par-4_84>Nate Jacobs mentions that Maddy is 17 years old in season 1, but the character celebrates a birthday in season 2, episode 4, so presumably, she is now 18. Alexa Demie,&nbsp;who plays Maddy is actually in her 30s. Twenty-five-year-old Barbie Ferrierea plays Kat, who is 17 years old in season 1. It’s hard to say what grade Maddy and Kat are in, but it’s possible that they are seniors with birthdays later in the school year, considering they hang out with Cassie a lot.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nate Jacobs and Cassie Howard are 18 in ‘Euphoria’ Season 2</h2><p id=par-5_87>It’s clear that Nate Jacobs is a little older than most of the girls on Euphoria. Nate is 18 years old, making him a senior in high school. He is portrayed by Jacob Elordi, who is 24 years old, according to The Mary Sue. Actor Syndey Sweeney is also 24 years old and her character Cassie is an 18-year-old high school senior as well. In Euphoria Season 1, Cassie dates Chris McKay, who is a 19-year-old freshman in college. He is portrayed by 27-year-old Algee Smith.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Some ‘Euphoria’ characters exact ages aren’t known</h2><p id=par-6_71>We know that Rue’s younger sister Gia is 13 years old, and according to The Mary Sue, she is still in middle school. The character is portrayed by Storm Reid, who is actually 18 years old. Other characters like Ashtray and Fezco don’t have their ages expressly mentioned. However, Rue does state that Fezco is a high school dropout. This means that he could still be around high school age.</p><p id=par-7_76>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GQ</a>, the 23-year-old actor who plays Fezco, Angus Cloud stated, “He’s still a kid like everyone else. He might be a year older, but he had to act like an adult from such a young age.” Based on this fact, Fezco is probably only around 19 years old. The Mary Sue estimates that his “younger brother” Ashtray is roughly 13 or 14. He is portrayed by the 15-year-old actor, Javon Walton.</p><p id=par-8_13>New episodes of&nbsp;Euphoria&nbsp;air Sundays on HBO and HBO Max at 9 p.m. EST.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSytrzHqKmimV2iwqS0jKijnZ2iYsC1rdGsZJygkaeupMDEq6pmqJ%2BnwbOt2KKloGaYqbqtew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
