New York City took the biggest hit, with sales of luxury homes – which are those in the top 10% of real estate sales – down 46.7% in the third quarter, compared to 2019. An early Covid hot spot, many wealthy New York City residents fled the city. Other markets such as Palm Beach, Los Angeles, the Hamptons, and Greenwich, Connecticut thrived in comparison. With the shutdown of things like offices, schools, and gyms, some wealthy people wanted to move into larger homes with more space for work from home, do homeschooling, and home gym setups. In Los Angeles, high-end home sales were up by 87.5%. In Palm Beach, high-end home sales were up 33.5%. In Greenwich, high-end home sales were up 68.2%, which ended a 10-year long slump in Connecticut's third most affluent city.</p><p>Of the top 10 real estate deals closed in 2020 in the U.S., two were more than $100 million and both of those home sales were in Los Angeles. Overall, L.A. has five of the top 10 sales, two were in the Hamptons, one was in Manhattan, and one was in Palm Beach, Florida.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-314219 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screen-Shot-2021-01-20-at-1.09.32-PM.png alt width=900 height=504 sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-314219 class=wp-caption-text>Warner Estate (Image via YouTube)</p><p>#10.
