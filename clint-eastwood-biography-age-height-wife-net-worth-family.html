Outside of work, Eastwood has led a hysterically convoluted existence and is described by biographer <a href=#>Patrick McGilligan</a> as a cunning manipulator of the media. His large number of partners and children are now reported matter-of-factually, but for the first three decades of his celebrity, his personal life was kept top secret, and several of his families were left out of the official narrative. The Hollywood kingpin refuses to disclose his exact number of offspring even to this day.</p><p>2012 saw him in a rare lighthearted movie, Trouble with the Curve (2012), as well as a reality show, Mrs.</p><p>Eastwood & Company (2012). And between screen appearances, Clint chalked up a long and impressive list of credits behind the camera.</p><p>Edgar (2011), Jersey Boys (2014), American Sniper (2014) (2014's top box office champ), Sully (2016) (starring Tom Hanks as hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger) and The 15:17 to Paris (2018).</p><p>Eastwood's next starring vehicle, Gran Torino (2008), earned almost $30 million in its opening weekend and was his highest grosser unadjusted for inflation.</p><p>In early 2005 he announced that he would supply the voice for a "Dirty Harry" video game. However, the game ended up getting canceled in 2007.</p><p>Eastwood surprised yet again in the mid-'00s, returning to the top of the A-list with Million Dollar Baby (2004). Also starring Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, the hugely successful drama won four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Clint. He scored his second Best Actor nomination, too.</p><p>He directed Mystic River (2003) (in which Sean Penn and Tim Robbins gave Oscar-winning performances), Flags of Our Fathers (2006), Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) (nominated for the Best Picture Oscar), Changeling (2008) (a vehicle for screen megastar Angelina Jolie), Invictus (2009) (again with Freeman), Hereafter (2010), J.</p><p>Until his pride was displaced by discovery of a larger version of same tree in 2002, Eastwood used to be proud owner of tree believed to be the nation's largest known hardwood - a bluegum eucalyptus.</p><p>His name is used as the title of the hit Gorillaz song and video "Clint Eastwood" (2001).</p><p>Received the Career Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. [August 2000]</p><p>Received an honorary Cesar award in Paris, France for his body of work. [February 1998]</p><p>Absolute Power (1997) and Space Cowboys (2000) did well enough, while True Crime (1999) and Blood Work (2002) were received badly, as was Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997), which he directed but didn't appear in.</p><p>Next up was a love story, The Bridges of Madison County (1995), where Clint surprised audiences with a sensitive performance alongside none other than Meryl Streep. But it soon became apparent he was going backwards after his brief revival. Subsequent films were credible, but nothing really stuck out.</p><p>Churning out a quick follow-up hit, he took on the secret service in In the Line of Fire (1993), then accepted second billing for the first time since 1970 in the interesting but poorly received A Perfect World (1993) with Kevin Costner.</p><p>Eastwood bounced back--big time--with his dark western Unforgiven (1992), which garnered the then 62-year-old his first ever Academy Award nomination (Best Actor), and an Oscar win for Best Director.</p><p>About this time, with outright bombs like Pink Cadillac (1989) and The Rookie (1990), it seemed Eastwood's star was declining as it never had before.</p><p>In 1988 he did his fifth and final <a href=#>Dirty Harry</a> movie, The Dead Pool (1988). Although it was a success overall, it did not have the box office punch the previous films had.</p><p>He then started taking on low-key projects, directing Bird (1988), a biopic of Charlie Parker that earned him a Golden Globe, and starring in and directing White Hunter Black Heart (1990), an uneven, loose biopic of John Huston (both films had a limited release).</p><p>Elected mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. It has often been claimed that Eastwood ran for office as a Republican. In fact, although he was registered as a Republican in California, the position of mayor is non-partisan. [April 1986]</p><p>Mentioned on T.G. Sheppard's hit single "Make My Day," which in the first half of 1984 reached #12 on Billboard's Hot Country Singles chart and also reached #62 on that magazine's Hot 100 singles survey.</p><p>The fourth <a href=#>Dirty Harry</a> film, Sudden Impact (1983), was the highest-grossing film of the franchise and spawned his trademark catchphrase: "Make my day.</p><p>Eastwood kicked off the '80s with Any Which Way You Can (1980), the blockbuster sequel to Every Which Way but Loose.</p><p>" Clint also starred in Bronco Billy (1980), Firefox (1982), Tightrope (1984), City Heat (1984), Pale Rider (1985) and Heartbreak Ridge (1986), all of which were solid hits, with Honkytonk Man (1982) being his only commercial failure of the period.</p><p>He branched out into the comedy genre in 1978 with Every Which Way But Loose (1978), which became the biggest hit of his career up to that time; taking inflation into account, it still is.</p><p>In short, The Eiger Sanction (1975) notwithstanding, the '70s were uninterrupted success for Clint.</p><p>At The 45th Annual Academy Awards (1973), he presented the 1972 Best Picture Oscar to <a href=#>Albert S. Ruddy</a>, the producer of The Godfather (1972). Thirty-two years later they would jointly accept the 2004 Best Picture Oscar at the The 77th Annual Academy Awards (2005), along with fellow Million Dollar Baby (2004) co-producer Tom Rosenberg.</p><p>Eastwood put out a steady stream of entertaining movies thereafter: the westerns Joe Kidd (1972), High Plains Drifter (1973) and The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) (his first of six onscreen collaborations with then live-in love Sondra Locke), the <a href=#>Dirty Harry</a> sequels Magnum Force (1973) and The Enforcer (1976), the road adventures Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974) and The Gauntlet (1977), and the fact-based prison film Escape from Alcatraz (1979).</p><p>1971 proved to be his busiest year in film.</p><p>He starred as a predatory Union soldier in The Beguiled (1971) to critical acclaim, and made his directorial debut with the classic erotic thriller Play Misty for Me (1971).</p><p>His role as the hard edge police inspector in <a href=#>Dirty Harry</a> (1971), meanwhile, boosted him to cultural icon status and helped popularize the loose-cannon cop genre.</p><p>In Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970) and Kelly's Heroes (1970), Eastwood leaned in an experimental direction by combining tough-guy action with offbeat humor.</p><p>-made western, Hang 'Em High (1968).</p><p>He followed that up with the lead role in Coogan's Bluff (1968) (the loose inspiration for the TV series McCloud (1970)), before playing second fiddle to Richard Burton in the World War II epic Where Eagles Dare (1968) and Lee Marvin in the bizarre musical Paint Your Wagon (1969).</p><p>The movies were shown exclusively in Italy during their respective copyright years with <a href=#>Enrico Maria Salerno</a> providing the voice for Clint's character, finally getting American distribution in 1967/68. As the last film racked up phenomenal grosses, Eastwood, 37, rose from television nonentity to sought-after box office attraction in just a matter of months. Yet again a success was the late-blooming star's first U. S.</p><p>Eastwood's big-screen breakthrough came as The Man with No Name in Sergio Leone's trilogy of excellent spaghetti westerns: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966).</p><p>Every year the PGA tour comes to Pebble Beach, Ca., to host a celebrity golf tournament where celebrities team up with the professionals. Clint participated in this every year from 1962-2002 and is the longest running participant. He now serves as Host.</p><p>Got his role in Rawhide (1959) while visiting a friend at the CBS lot when a studio exec spotted him because he "looked like a cowboy."</p><p>In 1958, he landed his first consequential acting role in the long-running TV show Rawhide (1959) with <a href=#>Eric Fleming</a>. Though only a secondary player for the first seven seasons, Clint was promoted to series star when Fleming departed--both literally and figuratively--in its final year, along the way becoming a recognizable face to television viewers around the country.</p><p>During the mid-'50s he landed uncredited bit parts in such B-films as Revenge of the Creature (1955) and Tarantula (1955) while simultaneously digging swimming pools and driving a garbage truck to supplement his income.</p><p>Returning to California in 1951, he did a stint at Fort Ord Military Reservation and later enrolled at Los Angeles City College, but dropped out after two semesters to pursue acting.</p><p>Some of his favorite movies are The 39 Steps (1935), How Green Was My Valley (1941), Sergeant York (1941), The Ox-Bow Incident (1942) and Chariots of Fire (1981).</p><p>Clint Eastwood was born May 31, 1930 in San Francisco, the son of Clinton Eastwood Sr. , a bond salesman and later manufacturing executive for Georgia-Pacific Corporation, and <a href=#>Ruth Wood</a>, a housewife turned IBM operator. He had a comfortable, middle-class upbringing in nearby Piedmont. At school Clint took interest in music and mechanics, but was an otherwise bored student; this resulted in being held back a grade. When Eastwood was 19, his parents relocated to Washington state, and young Clint spent a couple years working menial jobs in the Pacific Northwest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfmLmqutNmnJqrpKy8sLA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
