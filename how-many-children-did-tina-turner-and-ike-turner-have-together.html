In one chapter, the singer noted that Ike once sent his “stooges” over to shoot up her friend’s home after giving him divorce papers.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_72>“One night,&nbsp; we heard this loud ‘bang, bang, bang’ coming from outside. When we looked, we saw that the back window of Rhonda’s car had been blown out with bullets,” Tina wrote. “Another night, they actually shot into the house. We were so scared that Rhonda slept in the boys’ room, and I slept in the closet because the room had a skylight, and I was afraid there would be more shooting.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-are-the-former-couple-s-children-today>Where are the former couple’s children today?</h2><p id=par-8_63>When Ike and Tina officially divorced, the singer continued to raise their four boys.

Although she described him as a “shy” child, the singer admitted to noticing changes in his behavior before he died.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_55>“He was an introverted person; he was very shy, so I didn’t know either, except now when I listen back to our last conversations, I notice a change,” Tina said in an interview with <a href=#>BBC News</a>. “The last few times we talked, the conversations were different, and I didn’t know that until after the suicide.”<br></p><p id=par-12_33><strong>How to get help:</strong> In the U.S., call the <a href=#>National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> at 1-800-273-8255.
