Mike Epps is an actor/comedian – I mostly know him from films like The Hangover and Jumping the Broom. He’s become something of a solid character actor, mostly in ensemble films, although he was cast as Richard Pryor in a bio-pic produced by Oprah. Epps is 44 years old and he’s been married to his wife Mechelle Epps (the lady in these photos) since 2006. They have two children together. He’s too old, too married and too daddy-tastic to be hitting up random ladies on Twitter, but that’s exactly what he was doing Monday evening. He was apparently trying to contact a woman who goes by ceciCitra – go here to see her <a href=#>@CeciCitra Twitter</a>, because she’s really funny and her dream is to bang Rihanna (cosign). So Epps got in touch and this is exactly what went down, because ceciCitra totally screencapped this mess LIKE A BOSS.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>DAWG WTF LMFAO <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7TJTZhgaLv</a></p><p>— ceciCitra (@CeciCitra) <a href=#>August 18, 2015</a></p><p>In case you can’t tell, Epps was trying to get ceciCitra to DM (direct message) him on Twitter, probably because (I’m just guessing here) he wanted her to send him some dirty photos. The last tweet is from Epps’ wife Mechelle, and it’s just the emoticon for “eyes”. As in “I SEE YOU, YOU S.O.B.” After Mechelle dropped in, Epps deleted his tweets to ceciCitra (but not before she screencapped them and posted them on her Twitter). Epps also blocked her, because (I’m just guessing here) Mechelle had a pair of gardening shears in her hands and a certain look in her eye.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I. Am.

Yesterday, Epps retweeted a tweet that was directed at ceciCitra. She expressed surprise because:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I'm surprised she's even letting him tweet tbh that's an automatic one week suspension of internet privileges in my house</p><p>— ceciCitra (@CeciCitra) <a href=#>August 18, 2015</a></p><p>She’s also bothered by outlets using some of her old photos in their coverage, but I don’t see why she’s mad – she’s HOT.</p><p lang=und dir=ltr>Fml <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/PbIB80dzTi</a></p><p>— ceciCitra (@CeciCitra) <a href=#>August 18, 2015</a></p><p>What else? She tweeted: “funniest part of all this is I actually am on IG.” She laughed when her followers told her she should have tried to get a car out of him. And of course she’s been tweeting and retweeting memes about the whole Epps situation. Some days, I really do love social media.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>“DM me” <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/JsvlKXT8pr</a></p><p>— ceciCitra (@CeciCitra) <a href=#>August 18, 2015</a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/wenn20953671.jpg alt=wenn20953671 width=500 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbWxiboR1e8yiop6XlaW9tKvWop2el5OWwqi005ifoqWPqb%2B6tc2glq2nj5i%2FprHPmKanl5GUwbi1062cq5eWpLmtu9aeqZigmaGus7XOrqpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
