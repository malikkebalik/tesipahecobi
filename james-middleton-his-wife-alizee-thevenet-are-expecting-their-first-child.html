Carole was exposed as a serial grifter who defrauded banks and small businesses out of millions of dollars. We haven’t heard anything more about any of that in nearly four weeks. What was also interesting about the whole controversy is that the Middletons have wealthy in-laws – Prince William has private money, Pippa’s husband is terribly moderately wealthy, and James Middleton is financially supported by his wife Alizee Thevenet.</p><p>I always thought James was the black sheep of the family, the one Middleton with no hustle or business sense, just staggering from one financial disaster to the next. Now I know he’s a chip off the ol’ block. I have no idea what James’s latest failed business is – probably dog food? – but Alizee seems to make good money and she seemed fine with supporting their lifestyle. Except she’s going on maternity leave soon! Alizee is preg! James announced it on his Instagram, with photos of a bumped-out Alizee and their dog Mabel. Congrats to them, I guess. I really hope Alizee has a prenup. I hope she keeps her money completely separate from James and his grifter family. Anyway, Carole’s got another grandkid coming. She only seems to care about the royal grandkids, so who knows.</p><p>Photos courtesy of Instagram, Backgrid.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcWpkbX96e8mapJ6rj6K2pbDLnquopo%2BdtrSr1qKdnpeRoba7scSYq6Gdppq7psC%2Bmqmel5Wtvaav06KloJeknbKqvr6foKurpJSwqbXLnWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
