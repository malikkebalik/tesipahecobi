These apps have helped a number of up-and-coming stars break into the mainstream, expanding their reach and transforming their online presence from hobby into legitimate career. <strong>Brandon Farris</strong>, an American YouTuber, is among those who have managed to carve out a living for themselves solely through the followings they have built up online.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>Farris first launched his YouTube channel, aptly named <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ImBrandonFarris</a>, in 2013, but his career on YouTube didn’t truly begin for years after his first upload hit the platform. Still, all those years of experience have done the young influencer good. His videos, the first of which only got view counts between 10,000 and 20,000, have ballooned, with some of his most recent uploads gaining more than 3 million views within days.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>In total, this YouTuber’s videos have collected a whopping view count of more than 803 billion, with some of his most popular videos reaching upwards of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">9 million</a> individual views. His typical video fare sees Farris leaning into his comedic talent by poking fun at other YouTube channels, attempting truly terrible life hacks, and generally being a big-bearded goof.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=561 data-current-count=561 data-injectable=true>Over the last few years in particular, Farris’ star has risen high enough for him to be considered a robust YouTube creator. His vlogs, silly challenges, and popular “Google Translates” series have paid off for him in the form of YouTube ad revenue, sponsors, and partnerships. He typically uploads at least one video a week, but some weeks see him uploading up to three or four, giving his followers even more content to love. He has also channeled his success into an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">online store</a>, where he sells branded hoodies, t-shirts, coffee mugs, and even aprons.</p><p data-characters=667 data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true>On YouTube alone, Farris has amassed more than 3.56 million subscribers. He also has popular Instagram and Facebook pages, which, between them, boast upwards of 5.6 million additional followers. All this popularity has paid off in the form of YouTube earnings, which see Farris take home $6,500 a day, according to estimations from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nail Buzz</a>. This gives him an estimated net worth of more than $3.5 million, though between earnings from his online store and other viral pages, it is likely much higher in actuality. Some of his YouTube videos are also posted to <strong>Farris</strong>’ Facebook page, where they rack up additional views, likes, and comments from his eager fanbase.</p><p data-characters=77 data-current-count=77 data-injectable=false>Regardless of the exact numbers, this YouTuber is absolutely thriving online.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeppMK1wcGeZrCgkal6qr%2BMm6mappSku26ywKupoqtdo7K1edaoqa2gXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
