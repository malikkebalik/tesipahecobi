With heart-wrenching performances in movies like Blue Valentine, The Place Beyond the Pines, and La La Land (for which he got his second Academy Award nomination), he’s proved his versatility time and time again. Also, he sings in every one of those and shows off impressive vocal skills. In <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barbie</a></strong>, he sings the impossibly catchy tune “I’m Just Ken,” which he will perform at the upcoming <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oscars</a></strong>. So, is he a trained singer? The answer isn’t that simple.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>Gosling has actually always been a musician, and he’s even in a band called Dead Man’s Bones with bandmate Zach Shields, where he performs under the alias “Baby Goose.” Adorable! While trained may not be the word, Gosling has been singing and performing most of his life.</p><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true>Let’s take a look at his history with the aural arts. Believe it or not, Gosling’s always been a good dancer and singer. There’s even footage of him singing with his sister at a very young age at a childhood talent show. In the video below, he completely nails a very white but very good version of “When a Man Loves a Woman.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>He’s in his best ’90s outfit and he then teams up with sister Mandi to perform the all time classic “Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)” by the C+C Music Factory. It’s pretty clear that this kid had some outsized talent back then.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=229 data-injectable=false>The show must’ve caught someone’s attention because when Gosling was 12 years old he got hired as a Mouseketeer on the Mickey Mouse Club. His particular cast, by the way, was absolutely stacked with future superstars.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=true>Some names you might recognize include Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, JC Chasez, and the incredible singer Christina Aguilera. Quite the cadre of future famous stars there. Gosling was 12 when he joined the show, and it gave him a chance to really take his singing and dancing to the next level. In a sense, you could say he was “trained” to sing while on the show.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=318 data-injectable=false>Around this time his acting career also started to heat up, so instead of going the boy band route like his peers he scored roles in shows like Are You Afraid of the Dark?&nbsp;and&nbsp;Breaker High. Here’s a young Timberlake, Chasez and Gosling tearing up a soulful version of the song “Cry for Me.”</p><p data-characters=60 data-current-count=378 data-injectable=false>In another universe, Gosling was a member of NSYNC for sure.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=678 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>Now we’re getting into the early 2000s, when Gosling was in his early 20s. While his acting career continued to flourish with breakout roles in The Notebook and an Oscar nominated turn in Half Nelson, he never really stopped performing. Check out a slightly older Gosling playing acoustic guitar and singing with a YouTube user named Rich Clark.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true>It’s not known exactly when or where this performance came from, but just watch Gosling tear it up. He’s obviously in his element here, demonstrating that he not only has the voice of an angel but the fingers of one too. The sound isn’t great but the soul is obviously there.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=315 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>From this point onward, Gosling’s singing voice started popping up in movies. For example, he sings the classic Nat King Cole standard L.O.V.E. to a sex doll he’s fallen for in Lars and the Real Girl. It’s an unorthodox performance, but listen to that vocal vibrato and use of his falsetto voice.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true>Next let’s check out a clip from his band Dead Man’s Bones. This is around the end of the 2000s. The band played its last gig in 2012 and hasn’t really been active since then, but there was no word they broke up or anything so there’s always a chance we could get new music from the outfit at some point.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>In the next adorable clip, Gosling teams up with the Silverlake Conservatory Children’s Choir for a rendition of the original composition “In the Room Where You Sleep.” Fun fact about Dead Man’s Bones, by the way: the band’s genre is gothic rock and darkwave. What’s darkwave? It’s post new wave and post post-punk with a more gloomy edge to it.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=260 data-injectable=false>In 2010, Gosling starred in the heartbreaking movie Blue Valentine with Michelle Williams. Seriously, if you want to be depressed for a fortnight definitely go watch it, but if you value happiness stay far, far away. It is inarguably a beautiful film, though.</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true>With a ukulele in tow, he belts out a restrained version of “You Always Hurt the One You Love” and even puts on a fun Elvis voice while he sings it. Even though he tells Williams he “can’t really sing” he really puts on an endearing, believable performance of a man falling in love. Williams then says what we’re all thinking, that he’s actually good!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>This brings us to another heartbreaker in the Gosling catalog: The Place Beyond the Pines from 2012. Gosling plays a young guy with a motorcycle who gets caught up in a life of crime, but he also has a tender side.</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=181 data-injectable=false>In this scene, he even sings in Spanish. While it’s just a snippet, it’s another perfect example of Gosling’s on-screen charm and his seemingly effortless talent.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=227 data-injectable=false>Finally, we have what was probably his magnum opus – La La Land. Despite whitewashing the genre of Jazz, the movie lets Gosling show the full range of his musical ability. It also netted six Oscar nominations, not too shabby!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=527 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>After the whole Oscar debacle where La La Land didn’t actually win best picture, Gosling appeared on Saturday Night Live to, what else, sing about the whole thing. It’s a fun jazzy monologue full of humor and dancing. A true joy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=264 data-injectable=false>Gosling followed this up with another music-based movie, 2017’s Song to Song. He plays a musician who falls head over heels for Rooney Mara’s character, a guitarist. This leads to a difficult love triangle with a producer, played by Michael Fassbender.</p><p data-characters=130 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>One of the cool things about this movie is that it features real-life musicians like Iggy Pop and the Canadian duo Tegan and Sara.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=694 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=183 data-current-count=183 data-injectable=false>We’ve come full circle! Gosling’s excellent turn as Ken in Barbie features his most popular song to date: “I’m just Ken.” It’s an instant classic.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=108 data-injectable=false>So, is he a trained singer? If you count the Mickey Mouse Club, then yes. If you don’t, then kind of!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnRspinZZekwK21zaBkmmWkp66qusSdZKyhnpyys3nToZxmoZ1it7a%2F02ainqZdl7KtwMSrZJ6woKGuqrrEnWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
