Here’s what we know about their relationship status.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-liz-johnston-says-she-and-brice-felt-more-like-roommates-than-people-in-a-relationship>Liz Johnston says she and Brice felt more like roommates than people in a relationship</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-2_71>“So <a href=#>Brice and I</a> are no longer together,” an emotional Liz said in the March 12 season premiere of 7 Little Johnstons. “We have separated. Us living together, it felt more like roommates than we were actually in a relationship. I could not live like that. I’m not a person who wants to be in a relationship where there doesn’t feel like there’s any love or just, I don’t know, spark.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_41>Liz added that she wasn’t OK with being in a “mediocre” relationship, especially given the example that her dad and mom, Trent and Amber Johnston set for her. The 7 Little Johnstons parents have been together for more than two decades.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_73>“I have a lot of emotions,” Liz said when she was asked how she felt about the breakup. “I’m mostly angry, because things just change. And he is genuinely a good guy. But I tried to tell him, when the relationship starts to mentally affect somebody, when they don’t feel like they’re loved … they get pretty much depressed. I can’t live like that. So I decided separate from him.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-7-little-johnstons-star-welcomed-a-baby-in-november>The ‘7 Little Johnstons’ star welcomed a baby in November&nbsp;</h2><p id=par-5_38>The timing of Liz’s split from Brice – whom she started dating in 2018 – isn’t clear.
