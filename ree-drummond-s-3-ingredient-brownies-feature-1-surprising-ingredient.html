Drummond’s show launched back in 2006, and she’s been whipping up <a href=#>easy, hearty recipes</a> for her audience ever since.</p><p id=par-2_45>Drummond has her guilty pleasure foods just like anyone else — and there’s one sweet treat she keeps on hand at all times, though she makes sure to hide it from the rest of her family. Plus, she uses it for a quick dessert recipe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ree-drummond-5.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-1-treat-ree-drummond-always-buys-but-hides-from-her-kids>The 1 treat Ree Drummond always buys — but hides from her kids</h2><p id=par-3_37>Drummond has been <a href=#>cooking for her family</a> for years. And during her time on television, fans have grown to know what Drummond loves and hates. A perfect example: She’s never been shy about her distaste for bananas.</p><p id=par-4_52>It turns out there is one sweet dessert treat that Drummond can’t get enough of: Nutella. The chocolate hazelnut spread was created by Italian chocolate brand Ferrero (think: Ferrero Rocher chocolates), and it was first created back in 1963 despite that it only became popular in the United States in recent years.</p><p id=par-5_69>Drummond loves her Nutella, and according to <a href=#>Eat This, Not That!</a> she even hides it from the rest of her family to make sure her kids don’t eat it all. Drummond reportedly hides the sweet treat in her pickling pots, which is the one place she knows her kids wouldn’t think to look. (Though, now that she’s revealed that secret, she might want to find a new hiding spot.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ree-drummond-pioneer-woman.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-to-make-ree-drummond-s-3-ingredient-nutella-brownies>How to make Ree Drummond’s 3-ingredient Nutella brownies</h2><p id=par-6_30>It turns out Drummond not only can eat Nutella with a spoon but also can incorporate it into her recipes. And with this hazelnut spread, brownies have never been easier.</p><p id=par-7_12><strong>Ingredients:</strong><br>Nonstick cooking spray<br>2 1/2 cups Nutella<br>1 heaping cup all-purpose flour<br>3 large eggs</p><p id=par-8_62><strong>Directions:</strong><br>Preheat the oven to 350. Spray a large 9×13-inch pan with cooking spray, and set aside. In a large bowl, combine the Nutella, flour, and eggs. Spread the mixture evenly in the pan, making sure it gets all the way to the edges. Bake 25 minutes, or until the brownies appear set. Let the brownies cool slightly before cutting into squares. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/pioneer-woman-ree-drummond-2.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ree-drummond-is-used-to-buying-groceries-for-her-whole-family>Ree Drummond is used to buying groceries for her whole family</h2><p id=par-9_74>Drummond’s show becamse popular because she related so well to her fans. As a stay-at-home mother of four, Drummond was used to doing the grocery shopping and cooking for her family. But life on the ranch, combined with homeschooling the kids and sending them off to sports practice in town, meant Drummond often needed to create easy, make-ahead dinners, or meals that could be whipped up quickly at the end of a long day.</p><p id=par-10_46>Fans came in droves to Drummond’s Pioneer Woman blog to see and test her recipes; they loved <a href=#>how easy and hearty</a> everything was. The blog was started back in 2006. Fast forward 15 years later, and Drummond is one of Food Network’s most well-known celebrity chefs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMqaCoppWav27DzqaYp2WimrJusNGupKannpl6dHnIp56rnZSesq%2FAjJupqK%2BenrK0ecWemK2topp6tMHRqamiq5mjtG61zaCpnpyZmru1esetpKVn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
