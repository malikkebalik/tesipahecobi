Who shall take the blame for the boneheaded idea of cancelling out all 10 p.m. scheduling in favor of Jay Leno’s inane show? Who will take the blame for putting Conan O’Brien’s “not mainstream enough, yet not quirky enough” humor on The Tonight Show? Who will get the blame for millions of advertising dollars fleeing NBC like rats from a sinking ship? Who will get the blame for NBC not having any of the top twenty shows, week after week after week?</p><p>Well, it looks like the f-cking geniuses at NBC programming have decided to blame the talent. And I’m using that word “talent” loosely, of course. PopEater’s gossip guy is reporting that there are some rumors and theories being tossed around that Conan O’Brien is going to get the ax. Not just dumped… but replaced with NBC’s dream candidate, Jerry Seinfeld. Jesus… NBC is run and operated by the biggest idiots in the world:</p><p>With Conan O’Brien ratings slipping faster than Tiger Woods’ endorsement appeal, TV executives are telling me that informal discussions have started to occur within 30 Rock as to who would be the home-run replacement for the hysterical but sagging redhead. The name on everyone’s wish list? Jerry Seinfeld.</p><p>“NBC just can’t carry on like this. ‘The Tonight Show’ has lost 52 percent of its viewership in just one year. The November ratings will be the show’s lowest in 15 years. They would be idiots to not be having the replacement conversation,” a source tells me.</p><p>However, getting Seinfeld — who had a long, successful relationship with NBC in the ’90s and who, ironically, agreed to be the first guest when NBC moved Leno to 10 p.m. — is a long shot and Conan’s people are denying it entirely. NBC spokesperson Drew Shane responded: “Completely false. There are no conversations happening. Conan is the host of the ‘Tonight Show.'”</p><p>Way to stand by your man! We love Conan and want him to succeed no matter what timeslot he’s on.</p><p>[From <a href=#>PopEater</a>]</p><p>I think there might be something to the theory that some higher-ups at NBC want Conan gone, or shuffled back to late-late night. But I honestly think that if they made that douchey move (and it a douchey move, even if Conan does suck on the Tonight Show), they would offer the Tonight Show back to Jay Leno first. And Leno has already said <a href=#>he would take it back</a>, if offered. I sincerely hope everyone at NBC realizes what a magnificent clusterf-ck they’ve gotten themselves into. They deserve my scorn. I will never get used to watching Law & Order at 8 p.m. on a Friday!</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.picapp.com/ftp/Images/1/9/a/e/Opening_night_performance_4340.jpg width=580 border=0 alt="Opening night performance of David Mamet's 'Race' New York" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcW1kbn5ww8ilo5imkpiss7HPpZicnY%2BYvK%2BtzZimm6qZmrugw8itn5iilae%2FuqvSnqCnnpWhsXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
