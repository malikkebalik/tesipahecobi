During that same sequence, though, someone else got a mention; someone who was only referred to as “Meow Meow.”</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=775 data-injectable=true>Naturally, it’s easy for long-time fans of the show to identify former players when they see them on screen, but when a person is only mentioned by a moniker, it’s much harder to recall — especially in the case of a show that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has been going on for so long</a>. This, of course, means that viewers were left wondering who Meow Meow is, and where they’ve seen that person before.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who is The Meow Meow from Big Brother?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Enzo Palumbo (@enzp_)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=699 data-injectable=true>“The Meow Meow” is the moniker of former two-time Big Brother houseguest Enzo Palumbo. Does this name ring a bell? Well, it should, considering that Palumbo quickly became one of the most memorable contestants in the show. This is partly due to the moniker he chose, of course, but also to his sense of humor, which captured the attention of viewers and got many of them to root for him.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>If reality shows like The Challenge: USA are also up your alley, you may remember him from season one of the series, where Palumbo competed alongside other former Big Brother houseguests. Unfortunately, Palumbo quit the competition toward the end and placed fourth out of all the men.</p><h2 id=h-what-big-brother-seasons-did-enzo-palumbo-appear-on data-injectable=false>What Big Brother seasons did Enzo Palumbo appear on?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Enzo Palumbo (@enzp_)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>Enzo Palumbo first appeared in season 12 of Big Brother. In that season, Palumbo also formed an iconic alliance — The Brigade — that drove him to third place, something that inspired the contestant to try his luck on the show again, years later.</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>The contestant also made appearances in seasons 14 and 20 of the reality show, but not to be part of the competition. The next (and, so far, last) time we saw Palumbo as a houseguest was in season 22 — also known as Big Brother: All-Stars — where he lost the big prize to Cody Calafiore, ending up in second place.</p><p data-characters=88 data-current-count=88 data-injectable=false>Perhaps the third time will be the charm.
