Giving Bridgerton fans a more in-depth look at Queen Charlotte and King George III’s love story, this spin-off’s heartfelt and humane portrayal of what were previously mere side characters led to it <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hitting number one in several countries</a>.</p><p data-characters=566 data-current-count=953 data-injectable=true>Make no mistake, though — Queen Charlotte did more than explore already-established characters. To aid the retelling of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">historical events</a>, the show introduces some new elements to its franchise, and one of the most beloved aspects of it was the dynamic between the royal couple’s young footmen, Brimsley and Reynolds, played by Sam Clemmett and Freddie Dennis, respectively. Not only is the pair’s constant bickering and loyalty to their King and Queen incredibly entertaining to watch, but the characters’ relationship adds some drama to it all.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>Naturally, the enjoyment of watching the two interact on screen made it all the more heartbreaking when the sixth and final episode concluded without old Reynolds making a single appearance. Even worse, his absence from the show’s present timeline was never explained, leaving fans to wonder what happened to the character.</p><h2 id=h-why-don-t-we-see-old-reynolds-in-queen-charlotte data-injectable=false>Why don’t we see old Reynolds in Queen Charlotte?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=629 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>In the finale, a joyous dancing scene between Reynolds and Brimsley morphs into another, much sadder scene in which an old Brimsley (Hugh Sachs) dances alone in the dark. Of course, much too used to the “Bury Your Gays” trope, some audience members interpret this to mean that Reynolds has died — however, that was never the intention.</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>Speaking with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vulture</a>, Sachs revealed there was a scene in the Queen Charlotte script that included old Reynolds. Unfortunately, it was never even filmed before it was scrapped.</p><p>“There was a scene that we didn’t film, because it was cut, where I was going to meet the older Reynolds. He was the love of his life, and for whatever reason, they could not stay together. So when they would pass each other in the passageway in the deleted scene, it wasn’t a toxic moment. Because of the world they inhabited, it was still a hangable offense to be gay, and it was just not possible.”</p><p data-characters=524 data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true>This explanation of why Brimsley and Reynolds didn’t stay together makes some sense in a Regency-era piece, but it’s nevertheless disappointing to witness in a show that, in all other aspects, doesn’t shy away from bending history to its will. That said, it wouldn’t be surprising if, instead, these footmen had to live separate lives on account of their dedication to duty. In fact, that is the implication when in episode six, Queen Charlotte asks Brimsley if he never married, to which he replies:</p><p>“Who could I ever find who would be free to spend a lifetime with me? I am here. Everyone here cares for the King.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/queen-charlotte-a-bridgerton-story-reynolds-brimsley.jpg><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>Having witnessed young Reynolds’ loyalty and protection over the King, it would make sense for the footman to dedicate his life solely to caring for the monarch as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his mental health deteriorated with time</a>. This could mean that Brimsley would never be a priority in Reynolds’ life, something not too far-fetched considering how much information the character withholds from everyone over the course of the season, prioritizing the King’s wishes above all else.</p><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>Because the show never directly addresses what became of Reynolds, though, all of this remains speculation, meaning there isn’t a clear-cut answer to the question most fans are pondering over. While there’s no telling if Queen Charlotte will return for a second season to tie up this loose end, there’s hope that Bridgerton might one day offer a canonical explanation of why the two footmen are not a couple in the present timeline.</p><p data-characters=202 data-current-count=202 data-injectable=false>At the very least, it serves as some comfort to know that Reynolds and Brimsley’s actors are just as desperate to find out as the audience is. In conversation with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Decider</a>, Dennis had this to say:</p><p>“You’d have to ask Shonda what happened there. (…) I think this story has many more legs, actually, and I’d love to know what happens to Reynolds.”</p><p data-characters=98 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=false>Season one of Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story is currently available for streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKGZoKWyr7HDZquoZaKaxq%2B7y52qZqGeYr62scSnZJygkae5sMDTnmSapqOssrOxw2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
