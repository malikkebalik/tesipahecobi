The edit on "Love Is Blind" placed the coffee-shop scene before the break-up scene in the episode that aired, making it appear as though Jackie began a relationship with Josh, whom she also met in the "Love Is Blind" pods, before ending her engagement to Marshall.&nbsp;</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Jackie posted an apology to her Instagram story on Tuesday. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Instagram</span></span></figure><p>"I would also like to apologize and take accountability for my disparaging remarks as well in those leaked text messages," Jackie's public apology statement continued, in part. "It was tasteless and disrespectful to speak about anyone that way."</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>In the text messages in question, <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>shared in screenshots on TikTok</a> earlier in April, Jackie wrote that Marshall gives her "vibes," used to "twerk on the bed," and can sometimes be "sweet," and joked that she didn't want to hear her friends yelling about how Marshall has "sugar" in his "tank" at their wedding.</p><p>Some have <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-module=body_link data-analytics-post-depth=80 data-uri=07f0b16ca4937044a065e038131c7ae9 data-analytics-product-module=body_link>interpreted these as homophobic comments questioning Marshall's sexuality</a>. Jackie also wrote in the leaked messages that she and Marshall were making their relationship "stretch for TV," and she was separately spotted out in public with Josh around the time the messages leaked.</p><p>After they fell in love and got engaged while participating in the social experiment that encourages people to date each other and commit to marriage sight unseen, Marshall and Jackie's <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>storyline on "Love Is Blind"</a> largely revolved around their fights.</p><p>Jackie frequently complained on camera that Marshall wasn't as masculine as she'd like him to be.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertisement</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Marshall and Jackie on "Love Is Blind." <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Netflix</span></span></figure><p>After the controversy surrounding the leaked texts, Jackie and Josh didn't attend the <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>delayed "live" "Love Is Blind" reunion</a> because, as Jackie said in another Instagram story statement, <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Netflix and the couple were receiving "death threats."</a></p><p>Netflix didn't immediately reply to Insider's previous request for comment about the alleged death threats.&nbsp;</p><p>Jackie said that she and Josh "fought" to attend the reunion in person, but Netflix wanted to keep them "safe."&nbsp;</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Josh and Jackie appeared on the "Love Is Blind" reunion virtually. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Netflix</span></span></figure><p>Instead of appearing live, Josh and Jackie did a pre-taped interview with <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>"Love Is Blind" cohost Vanessa Lachey.</a> During the interview, the couple, who have been dating for a year, explained the timeline of their relationship. They also talked about their pets and said they didn't have plans to marry anytime soon.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>But <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module=body_link data-analytics-post-depth=100>as many viewers pointed out, Lachey failed to ask Jackie</a> about the insults she directed at Marshall both on- and off-camera. She also didn't bring up Jackie's leaked text messages at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>In her statement on Tuesday, she also thanked Marshall for taking "accountability" for the "derogatory comment" he made towards her during an off-camera fight while the season was filming. During the reunion special, when Lachey asked him to explain what he'd said after Jackie referred to his "derogatory" comment in her pre-taped interview with Josh, Marshall explained that he'd told Jackie she "could've been a man" during the off-camera argument and acknowledged it was out of line.</p><p>At the end of her apology statement, Jackie said that she never battled with her ex and asked for everyone to drop it: "Like Marshall said at the reunion we both deserve happiness, peace, and to be able move on from what transpired last year."</p><p>"Love Is Blind" season four is currently streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufonytu9WeZKKrXZe5qrrDZqGam5uesm6tz6ijqJ%2BZr7K0edOaqq2dnJrAtHnLnpiknZRiwabE06xkppmiqLWiuMtmaWlqY2KB</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
