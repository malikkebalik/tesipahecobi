He’s played countless iconic roles, from Ethan Hunt to Jack Reacher (just don’t mention The Mummy). He has also been credited with saving cinema, particularly with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Top Gun: Maverick</a>, which audiences showed up in droves to see. And now it looks like he’s doing it again with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part One</a>. But just how much money does the Hollywood star have right now?</p>Recommended Videos<h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tom-cruise-earns-a-lot data-injectable=false>Tom Cruise earns a lot</h3><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>If I told you that his average yearly salary comes in at about $50 million that would probably be an indication as to just how large his net worth is. His films make billions; Top Gun: Maverick raked in an impressive $1.49 billion <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">making it the biggest hit of his entire career</a> (so far). To be fair the actor received a fat paycheck of $100 million for that film up front, but that doesn’t even include the royalties he was no doubt paid, so he likely made a whole lot more.</p><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>So with the kind of sway Cruise has in the industry we know that studios will pay him ludicrous amounts for his films. Although, to be fair he earns it, as he performs pretty much all of his own stunts; there are countless examples of the actor putting his own life at risk doing something crazy — you can find the behind the scenes online, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that’s kind of what he’s known for.</a> However, he also produces a lot of the movies he works on, so that means even more credit for him.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-so-what-s-his-net-worth-now data-injectable=false>So what’s his net worth now?&nbsp;</h3><p data-characters=473 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>The actors net worth currently stands at $620 million, making him one of the richest actors/producers in Hollywood. That’s an insane amount of money — for context, other action movie stars have way less, take <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Henry Cavill</a> for example. The British actor’s net worth is $40 million. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sylvester Stallone’</a>s net worth is $400 million. Even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyonce</a> sits $120 million under Cruise, with a $500 million net worth (I know she’s not an action star, but she’s pretty rich.)</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=323 data-injectable=false>It’s likely Tom Cruise will only continue to rake in the money as his influence over audiences doesn’t seem to be waning. Plus he’s only sixty so he’s got a few more good years of acting if he wants. But then again; he could happily retire and live to a hundred without a single worry with that amount of dough.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMpqycoF2ewG7AzqZknKqlnsCmedaoqa2gXaO8uHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeSync - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
